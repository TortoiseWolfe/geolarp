## OWASP Top 10 Analysis

### A01: Broken Access Control - EXCELLENT

**Spec Coverage**:

- REQ-SEC-001: Payment data user isolation (P0)
- FR-001-004: Data isolation at database level
- RLS policies explicitly required
- User ID foreign key constraints

**Strength**: Explicitly calls out the vulnerability (placeholder UUID) and prescribes database-level enforcement. Defense-in-depth approach.

---

### A02: Cryptographic Failures - PASS

**Spec Coverage**:

- Password hashing via Supabase Auth (bcrypt/argon2)
- Session tokens cryptographically random
- OAuth state tokens as UUIDs

**Note**: Relies on Supabase Auth for crypto primitives. Acceptable delegation.

---

### A03: Injection - EXCELLENT

**Spec Coverage**:

- REQ-SEC-005: Metadata injection prevention (P1)
- Prototype pollution blocking (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`)
- Circular reference detection
- Nesting depth limits (2 levels)
- Size limits (1KB strings, array bounds)

**Strength**: Goes beyond SQL injection to address JavaScript-specific attacks (prototype pollution). Shows mature understanding of modern attack vectors.

---

### A04: Insecure Design - EXCELLENT

**Spec Coverage**:

- Explicit threat model section
- Risk assessment (before/after)
- Clear prioritization of critical issues
- Edge cases and attack scenarios documented

**Strength**: The spec itself demonstrates secure design thinking. Threat model maps attacks to mitigations.

---

### A05: Security Misconfiguration - PASS

**Spec Coverage**:

- REQ-SEC-008: Rate limiter initialization fix
- REQ-POLISH-001: Production logging discipline
- Pre-commit hooks auto-installed via npm

**Gap**: No explicit requirement for security configuration validation in CI/CD.

**Recommendation**: Add requirement for automated security configuration checks.

---

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components - PARTIAL

**Spec Coverage**:

- REQ-SEC-009: Pre-commit secret scanning
- CI pipeline as backup gate

**Gap**: No explicit dependency scanning requirement.

**Finding SEC-005-001**: No automated dependency vulnerability scanning specified.

- **Severity**: LOW
- **Recommendation**: Add requirement for `npm audit` or Snyk in CI pipeline.

---

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures - EXCELLENT

**Spec Coverage**:

- REQ-SEC-002: OAuth session ownership verification (P0)
- REQ-SEC-003: Server-side rate limiting (P0)
- REQ-SEC-008: Rate limiter initialization fix (P1)
- REQ-UX-002: Session idle timeout

**Strength**: Addresses the specific weakness (client-side rate limiting) with server-side enforcement. OAuth state parameter validation prevents CSRF.

---

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures - EXCELLENT

**Spec Coverage**:

- REQ-SEC-009: Pre-commit secret scanning (P1)
- CI pipeline backup gate
- Idempotency for webhook processing (REQ-REL-002)

**Strength**: Multiple integrity checkpoints: pre-commit hooks, CI gates, idempotent processing.

---

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures - EXCELLENT

**Spec Coverage**:

- REQ-SEC-007: Security event audit logging (P1)
- 90-day retention requirement
- Specific events listed (signup, signin, signout, password changes)
- Forensic data requirements (IP, user agent, timestamp)
- Queryable logs for admin review

**Strength**: Explicitly defines what to log, retention period, and queryability. GDPR/PCI-ready.

> **Retracted in part (#585, 2026-08-06).** "GDPR/PCI-ready" rested on a retention period that
> was **defined but never enforced**. `cleanup_old_audit_logs()` had no caller for ten months,
> so audit rows accumulated indefinitely — the opposite of the storage-limitation principle
> this line claims readiness for. Defining a retention period and enforcing one are different
> controls, and this audit checked only the first.
>
> Enforcement landed 2026-08-06 (`.github/workflows/data-retention.yml`). Note the privacy
> policy still does not state a retention period to users; that gap is tracked in #585 and is
> the larger of the two exposures.

---

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - N/A

**Assessment**: Feature focuses on client-side security hardening. SSRF addressed by Supabase Edge Functions architecture.

## Input Validation Analysis

### Email Validation

| Check             | Status | Notes                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Format validation | PASS   | REQ-SEC-006                      |
| TLD requirement   | PASS   | Must have valid TLD              |

| Disposable emails | PASS   | Warning only (balanced approach) |
| Normalization     | PASS   | Lowercase                        |

**Strength**: Balanced approach - validates format, warns on disposable, but doesn't over-block legitimate users.

## Audit Logging Completeness

| Event Type       | Logged        | Notes               |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Sign-up          | YES           | REQ-SEC-007         |
| Sign-in success  | YES           | With IP, user agent |

| Password change  | YES           | Security event      |
| Token refresh    | NOT SPECIFIED | Consider adding     |
| Account deletion | NOT SPECIFIED | Consider adding     |

**Finding SEC-005-003**: Token refresh and account deletion not in audit log requirements.

- **Severity**: LOW
- **Recommendation**: Add to REQ-SEC-007 for comprehensive audit trail.

## Secret Scanning Analysis

| Check           | Status | Notes                   |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |

| CI backup gate  | PASS   | Prevents bypass         |
| Error messages  | PASS   | File, line, secret type |
| Allowlist       | PASS   | `.gitleaksignore`       |

## Recommendations

### Should Fix (During Implementation)

1. **SEC-005-001**: Add `npm audit --audit-level=high` to CI pipeline
2. **SEC-005-003**: Extend REQ-SEC-007 to include token refresh and account deletion events

### Consider (Future Enhancement)

3. Add Content Security Policy (CSP) requirements
4. Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external scripts
5. Add security.txt for responsible disclosure

**Verdict**: PASS

Feature 005 is an exemplary security specification. The minor findings (LOW severity) do not block implementation. This spec should be used as a model for future security-focused features.

**Notable Strengths**:

- Explicit threat model with attack-to-mitigation mapping
- P0-P3 prioritization aligns with risk severity
- JavaScript-specific attack prevention (prototype pollution)
- Two-layer secret scanning (pre-commit + CI)
- Addresses specific vulnerabilities found in code review
