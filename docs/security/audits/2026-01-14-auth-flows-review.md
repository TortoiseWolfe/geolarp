# Security Audit: Auth Flows Review

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Auditor**: Security Lead
**Scope**: Feature specs 000-rls-implementation, 003-user-authentication, 005-security-hardening

## Summary

- **Risk Level**: LOW (specs are well-designed)
- **Issues Found**: 3 recommendations (no blockers)
- **Blockers**: 0

The authentication and security feature specs demonstrate strong security architecture. All three specs address OWASP Top 10 concerns appropriately.

## OWASP Findings

### A01: Broken Access Control

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- 000-rls-implementation: Comprehensive RLS policies (FR-001 through FR-025)
- 003-user-authentication: User can only access own data (FR-020, FR-021, FR-022)
- 005-security-hardening: Payment data isolation (Story 1), service role restrictions (FR-011-014)

**Strengths**:

- Database-level enforcement via RLS (not application-level)
- Empty results returned for unauthorized queries (no information leakage)
- Service role scoped and audited

### A02: Cryptographic Failures

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- 003-user-authentication: Password requirements include complexity (FR-003)
- 005-security-hardening: Pre-commit secret scanning (FR-042-047)
- Secrets stored in Supabase Vault per constitution

**Recommendation**: Spec should explicitly require bcrypt/argon2 for password hashing.

### A03: Injection

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- 005-security-hardening: Input validation (FR-017-020)
- Prototype pollution prevention explicitly addressed
- Depth limiting, size limiting, circular reference detection

### A04: Insecure Design

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- Threat modeling implicit in edge cases sections
- Abuse cases documented (brute force, OAuth hijacking, session hijacking)
- Rate limiting designed into specs

**Recommendation**: Create explicit threat model document linking features to threats.

### A05: Security Misconfiguration

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- 005-security-hardening: CSRF protection (FR-013-016)
- Error messages designed to not leak info
- Pre-commit hooks for secret detection

### A06: Vulnerable Components

**Status**: N/A (no code yet)

**Note**: Implement `npm audit` in CI/CD pipeline when implementation begins.

### A07: Authentication Failures

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- 003-user-authentication: Comprehensive auth flow
  - Strong password policy (FR-003)
  - Email verification (FR-004, FR-005)
  - Brute force protection (FR-016): 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Session management (FR-012-015)
  - OAuth with state verification (005: FR-005-008)
- 005-security-hardening: Server-side rate limiting (FR-009-012)

**Strength**: Rate limiting is server-side, not client-side (cannot be bypassed).

### A08: Data Integrity Failures

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- 000-rls-implementation: Audit logs immutable (FR-015-017)
- 005-security-hardening: CSRF tokens (FR-013-016), idempotency (FR-041)

### A09: Logging & Monitoring Failures

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:

- 003-user-authentication: Auth event logging (FR-031-033)
- 005-security-hardening: Security audit trail (FR-025-028)
- 000-rls-implementation: User can only see own audit entries (FR-018)

**Strength**: 90-day retention, no sensitive data in logs (FR-032).

> **Retracted in part (#585, 2026-08-06).** The retention half of this strength was not true
> when this audit was written and stayed untrue for ten months. `cleanup_old_audit_logs()`
> existed but had **no caller** — no cron, no workflow, no script — so nothing aged out. This
> audit rated a function that had never run. Enforcement landed 2026-08-06 via
> `.github/workflows/data-retention.yml`. The "no sensitive data in logs" half is unaffected.
>
> Kept rather than edited: this is a dated audit record, and what it concluded at the time is
> the point. The lesson is that an audit should verify a control **executes**, not merely that
> it exists in the schema.

### A10: SSRF

**Status**: N/A

**Note**: No URL fetching features identified in current specs. Monitor for future features.

## geoLARP-Specific Findings

### Supabase Security

**Status**: PASS

- RLS enabled on all tables (000: FR-001-005)
- Service role scoped and audited (000: FR-011-014)
- Service role key not exposed to client (000: FR-014)

### Static Export Security

**Status**: PASS

- Pre-commit secret scanning prevents key exposure (005: FR-042-047)
- CI pipeline backup gate (005: FR-046)

### Privacy (Constitution Principle VI)

**Status**: PARTIAL

- User data isolation strong (all three specs)
- GDPR deletion rights addressed (003: FR-027, FR-028)

**Recommendation**: Add explicit consent tracking for analytics in auth flow.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Explicit Password Hashing Algorithm

**Location**: 003-user-authentication spec
**Issue**: Spec requires strong passwords but doesn't specify hashing algorithm
**Remediation**: Add requirement: "Passwords MUST be hashed using bcrypt with cost factor 12 or argon2id"

### Priority 2: Threat Model Document

**Location**: docs/security/
**Issue**: Threat modeling is implicit across edge cases, not centralized
**Remediation**: Create `threat-model.md` mapping features to STRIDE threats

### Priority 3: Analytics Consent Integration

**Location**: 003-user-authentication spec
**Issue**: Auth flow doesn't reference analytics consent (019)
**Remediation**: Add dependency on feature 019 for GDPR-compliant analytics tracking

## Sign-off

- [x] All blockers resolved (none found)
- [x] Security Lead approves specs for implementation planning

**Next Steps**:

1. Toolsmith to address recommendations in spec updates
2. Security Lead to create threat-model.md
3. Proceed with wireframe and implementation phases

_This audit covers spec-level security only. Code review required during implementation._
