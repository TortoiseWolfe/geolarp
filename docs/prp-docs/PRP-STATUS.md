# PRP Implementation Status Dashboard

**Last Updated**: 2026-05-17 (Phase 0.5 / #48 Three.js Game shipped — PR #95 047)
**Previous Update**: 2026-05-14 (v0.4.x stabilization milestones)
**Total PRPs**: 16 (legacy) + 49 (SpecKit features — 000-brand-identity and 000-landing-page split out from 000-rls)
**Completed**: 15 legacy PRPs (v0.3.0) + 18 SpecKit features Shipped + 5 Mostly Shipped (019 GA moved Shipped → 23 total)
**In Progress (Partial)**: 19 features (most of payments tier, blog/sidebar polish, OAuth UX fixes)
**Not Started**: 4 features (013, 016, 028, 044)
**Backend Only**: 3 features (014, 040, 042)
**Current Phase**: v0.4.x stabilization — **E2E flake mitigation closed at round 10 on 2026-05-13** (concurrency mutex + WebKit scroll-event fix). See [STATUS.md](../../STATUS.md) for one-screen view.

> **Important note**: The 2026-04-25 audit was the first full sweep across all 47 features. Don't trust spec.md `**Status:**` fields anywhere — they were uniformly stale and have been refreshed in the Phase 4 spec-update batch. This 2026-05-14 refresh updates the dashboard header + hotspots table for the round-10 E2E closure and #31 GA4 closure; the per-feature audit data below remains the canonical detail.

## 2026-08-10 — Federating Community Platform — candidacy spec landed (authored 2026-07-18)

- **`docs/prp-docs/fediverse-community-platform-prd.md`** — 189 lines. Should the
  Chattanooga co-op's community need be met by **building** a forum + fediverse
  engine on geoLARP, or by **adopting** mature software (Discourse /
  Friendica) and spending the build budget on the one non-commodity asset, the
  place-anchored digital twin?
- **Status: Draft v0.1, decision tool — NOT a mandate, and it argues against its
  own subject.** The finding is that geoLARP's real data plane (group
  messaging, the dual-implemented RLS authorization contract, admin/audit shell,
  .NET backend, shipped 3D twin) shrinks the _first third_ of a forum build and
  does approximately nothing for the schedule-dominant two thirds — the
  self-governance triad, email deliverability, and an open-ended trust-and-safety
  product. Build ≈ **32-44 person-months**; Discourse + Friendica self-hosted on
  infrastructure already running is live in **weeks**, with CVE, interop and
  trust-safety risk borne upstream.
- **Recommendation: decouple and adopt.** The twin — the actual differentiator —
  embeds against Discourse just as well as against a bespoke engine, so it does
  not justify the build on its own.
- **No feature number, no SpecKit chain, deliberately.** This is a decision
  document, not a spec. It earns a number only if the decision goes the other way.
- Landed 2026-08-10 from an unmerged branch found during a branch sweep; it was
  the only one of 75 holding unshipped work. Indexed here so it is not an orphan
  in a directory instead of an orphan on a branch.

## 2026-08-06 — Commerce Catalog & Storefront (feature 050) — PRD landed + corrected

- **`docs/prp-docs/commerce-catalog-prd.md`** — server-authoritative product
  catalog, `/pricing` storefront, guest checkout, order record, intake uploads,
  and a pay-what-you-want tip jar. Ten SKUs across two lanes.
- **`docs/design/commerce/pricing-demo.html`** — the working design prototype.
  Reference only; it loads Google Fonts and encodes one rationale that is false
  against current code. Both are flagged in a banner at the top of the file.
- **Forcing function:** the `payment_intents` `amount <= 99999` CHECK makes a
  $1,200 quote literally impossible today.
- **Status: Draft, corrected.** Two audits checked every claim against the code;
  eight were wrong and are marked `[CORRECTED]` in place. Notably the original
  draft targeted `specs/016-`, which is both the dead tree and a colliding
  number — this is **050** in `features/payments/`, since 049 is reserved for
  Model City.
- Next: `/speckit.specify` → `clarify` → wireframe gate → `plan` → `tasks`.
  Do **not** use `scripts/prp-to-feature.sh`; it still writes to `docs/specs/`.

## 2026-07-18 — Model City / Chattanooga Digital Twin (feature 049) — PRD + PRP drafted

Concept extracted from the Claude Design prototypes into geoLARP docs (no code yet):

- **`model-city-prd.md`** (repo root) — the full vision: one project, three planes over the _existing_ `/chatt` twin (Tools / Play / Docs), equity-weighted, "explainable over accurate."
- **`docs/prp-docs/model-city-prp.md`** — scoped PRP for the **first slice** (the Model City planning board; alternative slice = the Registry + Civic League civic loop).
- **Status: Draft** (pre-SpecKit). Next: `./scripts/prp-to-feature.sh model-city 049` → `/speckit.specify`. Live roadmap: issue #115 (queued as the GreenField / Model City arc).
- Phase 0 (the browser twin) already ships as the `/chatt` Cesium atlas + `scripts/bake/` (#229/#232); the PRD documents net-new (registry / league / board / city-ops / vision) vs. built.

## v0.4.x updates since 2026-04-25 audit

Six PRs landed 2026-05-12 to 2026-05-14 closing the round-10 E2E flake pattern and improving fork-onboarding:

- **#86** `fix(docker): pin pnpm version` — Dockerfile pulled `pnpm@latest` which broke 2026-05-12 when pnpm 11.1.1 shipped a stricter PNPM_HOME/PATH check. Pinned to `pnpm@10.16.1` matching `package.json` packageManager field.
- **#88** `docs(auth): #85 replace stale Supabase project ref with placeholder` — 32 stale `vswxgxbjodpgwfgsjrhq` refs across 5 docs files swept to `<YOUR-PROJECT-REF>` placeholders.
- **#89** `fix(ci): serialize E2E runs via repo-wide concurrency mutex` — **closes 9 rounds of "ongoing" E2E flake mitigation**. Root cause was two concurrent CI runs racing against the same Supabase project (each run's `cleanupOldMessages` `beforeAll` hooks wiped data the other run was polling for). Fix: `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` `concurrency` group `e2e-supabase-${{ github.repository }}` with `cancel-in-progress: false`. Bundled WebKit scroll-event fix (4 `el.scrollTop = N` sites in `tests/e2e/messaging/` now also dispatch `Event('scroll', {bubbles:true})` since WebKit doesn't auto-fire it for programmatic scrollTop assignments).
- **#90** `docs(status): #31 close + round 10 E2E flake mitigation resolution` — STATUS.md refreshed with the round-10 closure framing.
- **#91** `docs(fork): add service-config checklist + auth verification section` — new `docs/FORK-CHECKLIST.md` (master walkthrough), AUTH-SETUP.md gains a Management API verification section that catches `placeholder_*` OAuth Client IDs in one line, README gains an Authentication Setup section.
- **#92** `chore: gitignore .screenshots/ + capture round 10 lessons in CLAUDE.md` — CLAUDE.md now has a "CI & E2E Stability" section codifying the concurrency rule, no-hook-bypass, the WebKit scroll quirk, branch hygiene, and CI API vs UI gotchas.

Issues closed:

- **#31** [Gap-Audit] 019 Google Analytics — closed 2026-05-13, code was already shipped (per-fork GA4 property config is per-fork work not code work).
- **#85** OAuth providers misconfigured — auto-closed 2026-05-13 when PR #88 merged. **Note**: the in-repo doc cleanup landed but the actual Supabase dashboard repair (placeholder Client ID → real OAuth client IDs) is still outstanding. See the issue closure comment for the recovery breadcrumbs.

Repo hygiene: `delete_branch_on_merge=true` set, 15 stale remote branches pruned 2026-05-12.

## v0.4.0 — Full 47-Feature Audit (2026-04-25)

This section is the canonical source of per-feature status. Generated by a 4-agent parallel audit cross-referencing every `features/<cat>/<NNN>/spec.md` against actual code in `src/`, tests in `tests/`, and the wireframes manifest.

### Stability hotspots (post-2026-03-04 remake)

The `feat/repo-overhaul-merge` (commit 2259a86, "cherry-pick of eval models A+B") on 2026-03-04 introduced patterns that have caused 18+ reverts and a ~5x increase in fix-rate. The same patterns repeat across code that hasn't been reverted yet. See [`scripts/audit/code-review-findings.json`](../../scripts/audit/code-review-findings.json) for the full 35 high-confidence findings.

> **Update 2026-05-13**: The "E2E flake mitigation" hotspot (rounds 1-9 in STATUS.md) is **resolved at round 10** via the concurrency mutex in PR #89. Rounds 1-9 attacked symptoms (stale closures, retry budgets, stagger delays, Supabase priming); round 10 found the underlying cause (concurrent CI runs racing each other's `cleanupOldMessages` hooks against one shared Supabase project) and fixed it structurally. The other 9 hotspots in the table below remain open. See [STATUS.md hotspot table](../../STATUS.md#a-stability--fix-the-post-remake-regression-patterns-highest-leverage) for the consolidated view.

## v0.4.0 — Foundation & Core (2026-04-08 audit, partial coverage; superseded by section above)

A direct-verification audit found that **~70% of non-payment feature status fields were stale** — many features marked "Draft" or "Ready for SpecKit" are actually fully implemented in production. Below is the corrected state based on reading the code (not the status fields).

### ✅ Complete — verified in production

### ❌ Not Started — real gaps

| [034 Blog Library Tests](../../features/testing/034-blog-library-tests/034_blog-library-tests_feature.md) | `src/lib/blog/` has 4 production modules (markdown-processor, seo-analyzer, toc-generator, blog-data.json) with **zero unit test files**. Real gap — blog library has no direct test coverage despite being used across production `/blog` routes. |

### 🗂️ Known tracking issues (out of scope for this audit, noted for later)

- **043 Group Service** — moved from `features/payments/` to `features/core-features/` on 2026-04-08. Depends on 009 messaging system. Has 8 unimplemented methods in `src/services/messaging/group-service.ts` (addMembers, getMembers, removeMember, leaveGroup, transferOwnership, upgradeToGroup, renameGroup, deleteGroup) — messaging UI exists but these methods are the backing work.
- **Other features not in the tables above** had their status fields reviewed and were either already accurate (rare) or could not be verified with direct file reads in limited time. A future audit pass should cover 001, 002, 004, 005, 010, 012–017, 020, 021, 023, 026–029, 035–037, 044, 045.
- **An initial audit via an Explore agent was unreliable** — it reported ~40% false-positive "Not Started" claims for features that actually have substantial code (006, 019, 025, 030 among others). The entries in the tables above were verified directly, not via the agent.

## v0.4.0 — Payments (Active Tracking)

**Reality check (2026-04-08)**: Payments are **far more built than initial status labels implied**. Most of the code exists — what's missing is activating API keys, writing 4 route files, and filling targeted UI gaps. An earlier version of this section labeled 038-042 "Not Started" — that was wrong; the foundations are there. This update corrects the picture.

**What exists**:

- **Client libraries** (`src/lib/payments/`, 1124 lines): `payment-service.ts`, `stripe.ts`, `paypal.ts`, `offline-queue.ts`, `metadata-validator.ts`, `connection-listener.ts`
- **Supabase Edge Functions** (742 lines Deno): `stripe-webhook`, `paypal-webhook`, `send-payment-email`
- **Database schema**: 5 tables (`payment_intents`, `payment_results`, `subscriptions`, `payment_provider_config`, `webhook_events`) with 20+ RLS policies
- **React components**: `PaymentButton`, `PaymentConsentModal`, `PaymentStatusDisplay`, `PaymentHistory`, `PaymentTrendChart`, `AdminPaymentPanel` — all with 5-file test coverage
- **Working routes**: `/payment-demo` (has passing Stripe + GDPR E2E tests), `/admin/payments`
- **Type definitions** + config: `src/types/payment.ts`, `src/config/payment.ts`
- **Env var contract**: All 6 keys listed in `.env.example`. `.env` has only empty commented template lines — no actual values yet

**What's actually missing (the real backlog)**:

1. **Obtain API keys** — create Stripe account + PayPal developer sandbox, set up webhook endpoints, populate 6 values: Stripe publishable + secret + webhook secret, PayPal client ID + secret + webhook ID. Public keys go in `.env` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`; server secrets go in Supabase Vault (accessed by Edge Functions via `Deno.env.get`). Budget 30-60 min of external account setup. Full walkthrough: [docs/PAYMENT-DEPLOYMENT.md](../PAYMENT-DEPLOYMENT.md). Forker-facing overview: [README.md "Payment Integration Setup"](../../README.md).
2. **3 route files** — wire existing components into new page.tsx files:
   - `/payment-dashboard` (038) — compose `PaymentHistory` + `PaymentTrendChart` + live-update subscription
   - `/payment-subscriptions` (038/040/041) — new component, list active subs, cancel/upgrade
   - `/payment-history` (039) — wrapper around `PaymentHistory` component
   - (`/payment-result` (040) shipped 2026-04-16 in commit `ffb33a1` — UX gaps remain, see 040 row)
3. **Targeted UI affordances** — some components don't exist yet:
   - Offline queue status indicator / sync pill / count badge / retry button / clear-queue (039)
   - Grace period banner, duplicate-subscription prevention (041)
   - Rate-limit UI for payment endpoints (042)
4. **Verify RLS policies** — policies are written; 25 E2E stubs in `08-security-rls.spec.ts` need to be un-skipped and run to prove each policy enforces what it claims (042)

**The 47 skipped E2E tests are still the acceptance criteria** — un-skip them as each gap closes. But "un-skip a test" sometimes means "just flip the skip flag" (if the code already works) and sometimes means "build the missing page/component first".

**Recommended next actions** (rough ordering):

1. **Unblock 024**: obtain Stripe + PayPal keys (create test-mode Stripe account + PayPal developer sandbox app, configure webhook endpoints), populate `.env` (public `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars) and Supabase Vault (server secrets), verify `/payment-demo` works end-to-end against sandbox APIs. (~1-2 hours including account setup)
2. **042 verification**: un-skip the 25 RLS tests one at a time, fix policies where assertions disagree. No new code, just verification + policy tweaks. (half-day)
3. **038 + 039 routes**: create `/payment-dashboard`, `/payment-history`, `/payment-subscriptions` page.tsx files wiring existing components (kebab-case, matching `/payment-demo` and `/payment-result`). Some stubs will go green immediately. (1 day)
4. **039 UI affordances**: build missing queue-status / retry / clear-queue components. (1 day)
5. **040 + 041 UX**: result page polish, grace period handling, duplicate subscription prevention. (1 day)

Each step should land its corresponding E2E tests un-skipped and green on the next CI run — that's how we measure "done" honestly.

**Tracking source of truth**: when work progresses, update (1) the `**Status**:` line in the feature file, (2) the row in this table, (3) un-skip the corresponding E2E tests and make them pass.

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns

**PRPs (Features)**:

- **Component Structure (PRP-002)**: 5-file pattern enforced via CI/CD ensures consistency
- **E2E Testing (PRP-003)**: Page Object Model provides maintainable test architecture
- **Docker-first development**: Consistent environment across all developers
- **Cookie Consent (PRP-007)**: Context-based consent management with localStorage persistence
- **Google Analytics (PRP-008)**: Privacy-first GA4 integration with consent mode, debug utilities
- **Web3Forms (PRP-009)**: Contact form with Zod validation, honeypot spam protection, TDD approach (98% coverage)
- **PWA Background Sync (PRP-011)**: IndexedDB queue, service worker sync, comprehensive offline support
- **EmailJS Integration (PRP-010)**: Provider pattern with automatic failover, retry logic, rate limiting, 100% test coverage
- **Calendar Integration (PRP-013)**: GDPR-compliant consent for third-party scheduling services
- **Geolocation Map (PRP-014)**: Leaflet.js with dynamic imports, OpenStreetMap tiles, GDPR consent modal

**Sprint 3.5 (Technical Debt)**:

- **Build System**: Next.js 15.5 works without Pages Router dummy files
- **Docker Integration**: Husky pre-commit hooks detect and handle Docker environment
- **lint-staged**: Fixed git stash issues with --no-stash flag
- **Performance**: Font loading optimized with display:swap and preconnect
- **Documentation**: Technical debt accurately tracked with TODO categorization

### Challenges & Solutions

- **CI/CD pnpm versions**: Standardized to exact version 10.16.1 across all workflows
- **E2E in CI**: Tests require dev server, made local-only with clear documentation
- **Missing dependencies**: Added to Dockerfile for consistency (Playwright deps)
- **PRP-009 Deferred Tasks**: Offline support (T010-T011) moved to PRP-011, enhanced security features (T012-T016) marked as optional future enhancements
- **PRP-011 Test Issues**: 4 integration tests fail due to React Hook Form async validation timing (production works correctly)
- **PRP-014 Desktop Accuracy**: IP-based geolocation limited to city-level accuracy, documented as PRP-015 for v0.4.0

### Process Improvements

- **PRP workflow**: Clear /plan and /tasks commands streamline implementation
- **Parallel task execution**: Identified independent tasks for faster completion
- **TDD approach**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle ensures quality

- [Original SPEC](./SPEC.md)
- [PRP Template](../spec-kit/prp/templates/prp-template.md)

## Notes

### Risk Factors

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: GA4 integration depends on cookie consent
- **Low Risk**: Calendar and geolocation are independent

### Dependencies on External Services

- Web3Forms: Requires API key
- EmailJS: Requires account setup
- Google Analytics: Requires GA4 property
- Calendly/Cal.com: Requires account
- Chromatic/Percy: Requires account for visual regression

### Technical Debt Tracking

#### PRP-011: PWA Background Sync

- **Issue**: 4 integration tests fail due to React Hook Form async validation timing
- **Impact**: Test environment only, no production impact
- **Tests Affected**: offline-integration.test.tsx (4 tests)
- **Root Cause**: Complex mocking of hooks with form validation lifecycle
- **Recommendation**: Split into focused unit tests + E2E tests
- **Priority**: Low (production works correctly)
