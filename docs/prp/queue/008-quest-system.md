## Status

## Priority
Medium

## Overview
Build an AI gamemaster quest system that generates location-based quests without backend, creates exploration challenges, and adapts to player behavior.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Location-based quest generation
- [ ] Exploration challenges working ("Walk 0.25 miles north")
- [ ] Four quest types implemented
- [ ] Offline progress tracking
- [ ] Procedural descriptions generated
- [ ] XP and item rewards functional
- [ ] Quest chains implemented
- [ ] Behavior adaptation working
- [ ] Template system with variables

## Technical Requirements

### Quest Types
```typescript
enum QuestType {
  EXPLORATION = 'exploration',  // Visit X locations
  COLLECTION = 'collection',    // Find Y items
  COMBAT = 'combat',           // Defeat Z enemies
  SOCIAL = 'social'            // Find players via QR
}

interface Quest {
  id: string;
  type: QuestType;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  objectives: Objective[];
  rewards: Reward[];
  progress: Progress;
  chainId?: string;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}
```

### Quest Generation
- Location-based templates
- Variable substitution
- Distance calculations
- Difficulty scaling
- Chain prerequisites
- Daily/weekly quests

### Template System
```
"Walk {distance} miles {direction} to find the {item}"
"Defeat {count} {enemy_type} near {landmark}"
"Collect {count} {resource} from {area_type}"
```

## Testing Requirements
- Quest generation tests
- Progress tracking validation
- Reward distribution tests
- Chain completion tests
- Offline functionality tests

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Quests generate from location
2. Progress tracked offline
3. Rewards distributed correctly
4. Chains work properly
5. Templates produce variety

## Rotation Plan
- Extract quest templates to content
- Generation algorithm to ADR
- Archive after implementation
- Tests validate generation
