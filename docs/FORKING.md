# Forking ScriptHammer

Complete guide to creating your own project from the ScriptHammer template.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
gh repo fork TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer --clone
cd YourProjectName

# 2. Run the rebrand script. It refuses without an icon decision -- see "Your brand
#    mark is not covered by any of that" below. Use --no-icon if you have no mark yet.
./scripts/rebrand.sh MyProject myusername "My awesome project description" --icon path/to/mark.svg

# 3. Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# macOS/Linux: .env will hold service and payment credentials; make it owner-only now.
chmod 600 .env
# Edit .env - set UID and GID (run: id -u && id -g)

# 4. Start Docker
docker compose up -d

# 5. Verify build
docker compose run --rm builder pnpm run build

# 6. Run tests
docker compose exec myproject pnpm test

# 7. Commit and push
docker compose exec myproject git add -A
docker compose exec myproject git commit -m "Rebrand to MyProject"
git push
```

## What the Rebrand Script Does

The `scripts/rebrand.sh` script automates updating 200+ files:

| Category  | Changes                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Code**  | Replaces "ScriptHammer" with your project name in all TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, and Markdown files |
| **Files** | Renames files containing "ScriptHammer" (e.g., `ScriptHammerLogo.tsx` → `MyProjectLogo.tsx`)           |

### Your brand mark is not covered by any of that

A rebrand substitutes strings, and **a logo is not a string**. Nothing in the
table above looks at an image, so without a mark of your own every browser tab
and every home-screen install shows ScriptHammer's icon.

This is not a hypothetical: it has reached production twice, on two different
live sites, the second time straight past a warning added to prevent the first.
So `rebrand.sh` now **refuses to run** until you decide:

```bash
# You have a mark — .svg, .png and .webp all work
./scripts/rebrand.sh "MyApp" myuser "My description" --icon path/to/mark.svg

# You do not have one yet, and you are choosing to ship ours for now
./scripts/rebrand.sh "MyApp" myuser "My description" --no-icon
```

`--icon` regenerates the whole set — favicon, the eight PWA sizes, the maskable
variants, `apple-touch-icon`, and `favicon.ico` — from your single mark. Use a
**symbol rather than a wordmark**: these render down to 32px, where text is
illegible.

If you take `--no-icon`, the icons stay ScriptHammer's until you run
`pnpm run generate:icons` with your own mark. `pnpm run check:icons` tells you
whether the committed set still matches it.
| **Docker** | Updates service name in `docker-compose.yml` |
| **Git** | Updates remote origin URL to your repository |
| **Config** | Updates `package.json` name, description, and repository fields |
| **Themes** | Renames `scripthammer-dark`/`scripthammer-light` theme blocks to your project name |
| **Env** | Updates `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and example commands in `.env.example` |
| **CNAME** | Updates `public/CNAME` to your project domain (unless custom domain detected or `--keep-cname`) |

### Script Options

```bash
# Every invocation needs --icon or --no-icon. These examples use --icon; swap in
# --no-icon if you have no mark yet.

# Preview changes (no modifications)
./scripts/rebrand.sh MyProject myuser "Description" --icon mark.svg --dry-run

# Skip all prompts
./scripts/rebrand.sh MyProject myuser "Description" --icon mark.svg --force

# Keep public/CNAME exactly as it is. NOTE: on a fresh fork that file contains
# ScriptHammer's own domain, so this is only right if you have already replaced it.
./scripts/rebrand.sh MyProject myuser "Description" --icon mark.svg --keep-cname

# Preserve SSH format for git remote (if your origin is SSH)
./scripts/rebrand.sh MyProject myuser "Description" --icon mark.svg --preserve-ssh

# Combine options
./scripts/rebrand.sh MyProject myuser "Description" --no-icon --dry-run --preserve-ssh
```

| Option                   | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dry-run`              | Preview changes without modifying files                                                            |
| `--force`                | Skip all confirmation prompts                                                                      |
| `--keep-cname`           | Don't update `public/CNAME` file (keep existing domain)                                            |
| `--preserve-ssh`         | Keep SSH format (`git@github.com:`) if currently using SSH                                         |
| `--preserve-attribution` | **No-op.** Attribution is always kept — see below. Still parses, so scripts passing it don't break |

### Keeping a string through a rebrand — `rebrand:keep`

Put `rebrand:keep` in a comment **on the same line** as any string that must
survive. The script skips that line in every replacement pass:

```ts
// src/config/footer-links.ts
href: 'https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer', // rebrand:keep
label: 'ScriptHammer', // rebrand:keep
```

Three things worth knowing:

- **It is line-scoped, not file-scoped.** A marker at the top of a file protects
  nothing below it.
- **The token is deliberately brand-neutral.** `scripthammer:keep` would contain
  the very string the second replacement pass searches for — a self-referential
  trap.
- **The attribution link uses this**, which is why `--preserve-attribution` is
  now a no-op. Before #513 the flag skipped any file matching `*Footer*`
  case-sensitively, and the attribution had moved to the lowercase
  `src/config/footer-links.ts` — so the one file the flag existed to protect was
  the one file it never matched. Every fork silently lost the link back,
  including forks whose owners would have kept it.

**Removing the attribution is a one-line edit and you are welcome to make it.**
It is MIT. The default is "kept" so that losing it is a decision rather than an
accident.

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                  |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| 0    | Success                  |
| 1    | Invalid arguments        |
| 2    | User declined re-rebrand |
| 3    | Git error                |

## Customizing Your Theme

The rebrand script renames the ScriptHammer theme blocks to your project name but keeps the same colors. To customize:

1. Edit `src/app/globals.css` — change the oklch color values in the `@plugin "daisyui/theme"` blocks
2. Run Storybook to preview: `docker compose exec <project> pnpm run storybook`
3. Use the theme switcher in the Storybook toolbar to verify both dark and light variants

See [CUSTOM-THEME.md](./CUSTOM-THEME.md) for the full guide including color format, WCAG contrast requirements, and all files that reference the theme.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings → Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions** as source
3. Push to `main` branch to trigger deployment

### Required Secrets and Variables

Both live under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, on two different tabs, and
**the tab matters** — putting a value in the wrong one does not error, it arrives as an empty
string and the site builds without it.

#### Repository SECRETS — required, the deploy hard-fails without this one

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` checks this before it runs the build and exits 1 if it is empty.
It is the single thing standing between your first push and any site existing. (It ships in the
client bundle either way, so it is a "secret" only by storage location.)

#### Repository VARIABLES — not secrets

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOY_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

`deploy.yml` reads all four from `vars.*`. Put the Supabase pair in Secrets and the deploy still
succeeds — with no backend in the bundle, and the setup banner on every page.

Set the two URLs even if you are not on a custom domain yet: `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` fall
back to a `github.io` origin without them, and the asset-retention step falls back to crawling
**this template's** site rather than yours.

#### Recommended for E2E Testing

These enable full E2E test coverage:

```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
TEST_USER_PRIMARY_EMAIL=yourname+test-a@gmail.com
TEST_USER_PRIMARY_PASSWORD=TestPassword123!
TEST_USER_SECONDARY_EMAIL=yourname+test-b@gmail.com
TEST_USER_SECONDARY_PASSWORD=TestPassword456!
TEST_USER_TERTIARY_EMAIL=yourname+test-c@gmail.com
TEST_USER_TERTIARY_PASSWORD=TestPassword789!
TEST_EMAIL_DOMAIN=yourname+e2e@gmail.com
```

> **Important: Email Domain Requirements**
>
> Supabase Auth validates that email domains have valid MX (mail exchange) records.
> `@example.com` is a reserved domain and will **always be blocked**.
>
> **Use Gmail plus aliases** instead: `yourname+test@gmail.com`
>
> The plus alias format allows unlimited unique emails that all arrive at your
> inbox but Supabase treats each as a separate user.

#### Optional

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_NAME=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_EMAIL=your@email.com
```

See [README.md](../README.md#-github-actions-secrets) for the complete prioritized list of secrets.

### basePath Auto-Detection

The deployment automatically detects your repository name and sets the correct basePath for GitHub Pages. No `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` secret is required.

## Supabase Setup

While Supabase env vars are unset, you'll see a yellow "Setup required" banner on every page of the running app. This is intentional — it disappears automatically once `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are populated. The banner is also dismissible via the × button if you want to focus on non-Supabase features first.

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Copy your project URL and anon key from **Settings → API**

### 2. Add Environment Variables

```bash
# .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations

The project uses a monolithic migration file. To set up your database:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251006_complete_monolithic_setup.sql`
3. Run the SQL

### 4. Add GitHub Secrets

Add the same values as GitHub repository secrets for deployment.

## Docker Git Workflow

Git commits from inside the Docker container are fully supported:

```bash
# Set your git identity (add to .env)
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=Your Name
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=your@email.com

# Then commit from container
docker compose exec myproject git add -A
docker compose exec myproject git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push  # Push from host (SSH keys on host)
```

## Verification Checklist

After forking, verify everything works:

- [ ] `docker compose up` starts without errors
- [ ] `docker compose exec <project> pnpm test` — all tests pass
- [ ] `docker compose run --rm builder pnpm run build` — build succeeds
- [ ] No "ScriptHammer" references in `package.json`
- [ ] `git remote -v` shows your repository URL
- [ ] `.env` has `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<yourproject>` (not `scripthammer`)
- [ ] `.env` is owner-only (`chmod 600 .env`) before it contains credentials
- [ ] `public/CNAME` contains your domain (or is absent if no custom domain)
- [ ] `docker compose ps` shows your project name in container names
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment succeeds (if enabled)
- [ ] Site loads at `https://username.github.io/project-name/`

### Port Variables

The `SH_*` port environment variables (`SH_PORT`, `SH_STORYBOOK_PORT`, etc.) are inherited from the template and work as-is. They control host port bindings in `docker-compose.yml`. You can customize them in `.env` if you need fixed ports, but the defaults (ephemeral assignment) prevent collisions automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail Without Supabase

Unit tests should pass without Supabase environment variables thanks to comprehensive mocks in `tests/setup.ts`. If tests fail:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the template
2. Check that no test is directly importing from `@supabase/supabase-js`

### E2E Tests Fail with "Invalid email" Errors

Supabase Auth validates email domains have MX records. Common causes:

1. **Using `@example.com`**: This reserved domain is always blocked
2. **Missing TEST_EMAIL_DOMAIN**: Set this env var to use Gmail plus aliases

**Fix**: Use Gmail plus alias format in your `.env`:

```bash
TEST_EMAIL_DOMAIN=yourname+e2e@gmail.com
TEST_USER_PRIMARY_EMAIL=yourname+test-a@gmail.com
```

### E2E Tests Create Multiple Users per Test

The `session-persistence.spec.ts` test previously created users in `beforeEach` instead of `beforeAll`, causing rate limits. This is fixed in the template but if you see rate limit errors:

1. Check that `beforeAll` is used for user creation (not `beforeEach`)
2. Use unique email prefixes via `generateTestEmail('unique-prefix')`

### Build Fails After Rebrand

1. Run `docker compose down && docker compose up --build` to rebuild
2. Check for any remaining "ScriptHammer" references: `grep -r "ScriptHammer" src/`
3. Ensure all import paths are correct after file renames

### GitHub Pages Shows 404

1. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" source
2. Check Actions tab for deployment errors
3. Wait a few minutes after deployment completes
4. Clear browser cache

### Permission Errors

Always use Docker commands, never `sudo`:

```bash
# Wrong
sudo rm -rf node_modules

# Correct
docker compose exec <project> rm -rf node_modules
```

## Syncing with Upstream (ScriptHammer)

Keep your fork updated with improvements from ScriptHammer:

### One-Time Setup

```bash
# Add ScriptHammer as upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/YOU/YOUR-PROJECT.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer.git (fetch)
```

### Pulling Updates

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream into your main branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Resolve any conflicts, then push
git push origin main
```

### Cherry-Picking Specific Commits

If you only want specific fixes:

```bash
# View upstream commits
git log upstream/main --oneline -20

# Cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### After Pulling Updates

1. Rebuild Docker: `docker compose down && docker compose up --build`
2. Run tests: `docker compose exec <project> pnpm test`
3. Check for new environment variables in `.env.example`

### If Merge Conflicts Are Too Complex

Open an issue with the conflicting paths on
[ScriptHammer Issues](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer/issues). Upstream
changes that conflict badly for one fork usually conflict for others, so they are worth
reporting rather than working around alone.
