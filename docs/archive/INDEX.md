# GeoLARP Archive

## Purpose
This archive contains completed PRPs, extracted decisions, and lessons learned. It serves as a historical record of what was planned, what was built, and why decisions were made.

## Structure

### `/prp/` - Completed PRPs
Organized by quarter, these are the original specifications that guided implementation.

#### 2024-Q4
- (Empty - project starting)

### `/decisions/` - Extracted Architectural Decisions
Important decisions extracted from PRPs after implementation.

### `/learnings/` - Lessons Learned
Post-mortems and insights from completed implementations.

## Navigation

| Date | PRP | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|---------------|-------|
| TBD | - | - | - | Project initialized |

## Rotation Log

Track when PRPs move from active to archived:

```
Date       | PRP ID | Title | Developer | Outcome
-----------|--------|-------|-----------|----------
YYYY-MM-DD | 001    | TBD   | TBD       | TBD
```

## Success Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: X% of PRPs fully implemented
- **Average Cycle Time**: X days from active to archived
- **Test Coverage**: X% of PRP requirements have tests
- **Decision Extraction**: X decisions documented
