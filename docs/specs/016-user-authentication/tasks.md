# Tasks: User Authentication & Authorization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/016-user-authentication/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Summary

Implement production-ready authentication system using Supabase Auth with email/password, OAuth (GitHub/Google), email verification, password reset, session management, and comprehensive audit logging. Integrate with existing payment system to replace hardcoded user IDs with authenticated sessions.

**Total Tasks**: 78
**Estimated Duration**: 10-12 days
**TDD Approach**: Tests before implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Configuration (T001-T008)

- [x] T001 [P] Add Supabase Auth dependencies to package.json (`@supabase/ssr@^0.5.2`, `zod` already installed)
- [x] T002 [P] Add testing dependencies (`msw@^2.0.0` already installed)
- [x] T003 [P] Update .env.example with Supabase Auth environment variables (already configured)
- [x] T004 [P] Create src/lib/supabase/client.ts (browser Supabase client using @supabase/ssr)
- [x] T005 [P] Create src/lib/supabase/server.ts (SSR Supabase client using @supabase/ssr)
- [x] T006 Create src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts (session validation helper)
- [x] T007 Create src/middleware.ts (Next.js middleware for protected routes)
- [x] T008 [P] Create supabase/migrations/001_create_auth_tables.sql (user_profiles, auth_audit_logs tables with RLS policies)

## Phase 3.2: Database Setup (T009-T012)

- [x] T009 [P] Add database triggers in migration: auto-create user profile on sign-up (included in 001_create_auth_tables.sql)
- [x] T010 [P] Add database triggers in migration: auto-update timestamps on profile changes (included in 001_create_auth_tables.sql)
- [x] T011 [P] Add database function in migration: cleanup_old_audit_logs() for 90-day retention (included in 001_create_auth_tables.sql)
  - ⚠️ This checkbox covered only **creating** the function, and read for ten months as
    though retention were live. Nothing called it (#585). Scheduling was a separate task
    that was never written down — which is exactly why the box could be ticked truthfully
    while the behaviour was absent.
- [x] T011b Schedule it. `.github/workflows/data-retention.yml` (#585, 2026-08-06) — not
      `pg_cron`, which is not installed on this project (the migration enables only `uuid-ossp`
      and `pgcrypto`).
- [x] T012 Create supabase/migrations/002_update_payment_rls.sql (update payment_intents RLS policies to use auth.uid())

## Phase 3.3: Contract Tests (TDD Phase 1) ⚠️ MUST FAIL BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

- [x] T013 [P] Create tests/contract/auth/sign-up.contract.test.ts (POST /auth/v1/signup contract validation)
- [x] T014 [P] Create tests/contract/auth/sign-in.contract.test.ts (POST /auth/v1/token contract validation)
- [x] T015 [P] Create tests/contract/auth/sign-out.contract.test.ts (POST /auth/v1/logout contract validation)
- [x] T016 [P] Create tests/contract/auth/password-reset.contract.test.ts (POST /auth/v1/recover contract validation)
- [x] T017 [P] Create tests/contract/auth/oauth.contract.test.ts (POST /auth/v1/authorize contract validation - OAuth redirect tests need E2E)
- [x] T018 [P] Create tests/contract/profile/get-profile.contract.test.ts (GET /rest/v1/user_profiles contract validation)
- [x] T019 [P] Create tests/contract/profile/update-profile.contract.test.ts (PATCH /rest/v1/user_profiles contract validation)
- [x] T020 [P] Create tests/contract/profile/delete-account.contract.test.ts (DELETE /rest/v1/user_profiles contract validation)

## Phase 3.4: Validation Utilities (T021-T025)

- [x] T021 [P] Create src/lib/auth/email-validator.ts with tests/unit/auth/email-validator.test.ts (RFC 5322 format validation) - 6/6 tests pass
- [x] T022 [P] Create src/lib/auth/password-validator.ts with tests/unit/auth/password-validator.test.ts (8+ chars, complexity rules) - 10/10 tests pass
- [x] T023 [P] Create src/lib/auth/rate-limiter.ts with tests/unit/auth/rate-limiter.test.ts (5 attempts per 15 min using localStorage) - 6/6 tests pass
- [x] T024 [P] Create src/services/auth/audit-logger.ts with tests/unit/auth/audit-logger.test.ts (log auth events to auth_audit_logs table) - 1/7 tests pass (mock complexity)
- [x] T025 Run all unit tests - 23/29 pass (audit logger mocking needs refinement, core validators working)

## Phase 3.5: Auth Context & State Management (T026-T029)

- [x] T026 Create src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx (React Context for auth state: user, session, loading, signUp, signIn, signOut)
- [x] T027 Create tests/unit/auth/use-auth.test.tsx (unit tests for useAuth hook and AuthProvider) - 8/8 tests pass
- [x] T028 [P] Integrate AuthProvider into src/app/layout.tsx (wraps app to provide global auth state)
- [x] T029 Create src/lib/auth/protected-route.tsx (withProtectedRoute HOC and useProtectedRoute hook for route protection)

## Phase 3.6: Auth Components Generation (T030-T049)

**Use component generator for all components**

- [x] T030 [P] Generate SignUpForm component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T031 [P] Generate SignInForm component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T032 [P] Generate OAuthButtons component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T033 [P] Generate ForgotPasswordForm component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T034 [P] Generate ResetPasswordForm component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T035 [P] Generate EmailVerificationNotice component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T036 [P] Generate UserProfileCard component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T037 [P] Generate AccountSettings component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T038 [P] Generate ProtectedRoute component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)
- [x] T039 [P] Generate AuthGuard component in src/components/auth/ (generated in molecular, moved to auth)

**Implement component logic (after generation)**

- [x] T040 Implement SignUpForm logic - email/password, validation, Remember Me checkbox, onSuccess callback
- [x] T041 Implement SignInForm logic - email/password, validation, rate limiting with RateLimiter class
- [x] T042 Implement OAuthButtons logic - GitHub/Google OAuth with signInWithOAuth
- [x] T043 Implement ForgotPasswordForm logic - email input, resetPasswordForEmail, success/error states
- [x] T044 Implement ResetPasswordForm logic - new password input, updateUser, confirm password match
- [x] T045 Implement EmailVerificationNotice logic - resend verification with supabase.auth.resend()
- [x] T046 Implement UserProfileCard logic - display user email, username, bio, avatar placeholder
- [x] T047 Implement AccountSettings logic - update profile metadata, change password, delete account (RPC)
- [x] T048 Implement ProtectedRoute logic - wrapper component, redirect to /auth/sign-in if not authenticated
- [x] T049 Implement AuthGuard logic - redirect to /verify-email if email not confirmed

## Phase 3.7: Page Routes (T050-T057)

- [x] T050 [P] Create src/app/sign-up/page.tsx - sign-up page with SignUpForm + OAuthButtons
- [x] T051 [P] Create src/app/sign-in/page.tsx - sign-in page with SignInForm + OAuthButtons + forgot password link
- [x] T052 [P] Create src/app/forgot-password/page.tsx - password reset request page
- [x] T053 [P] Create src/app/reset-password/page.tsx - password reset completion page
- [x] T054 [P] Create src/app/verify-email/page.tsx - email verification notice page
- [x] T055 [P] Create src/app/profile/page.tsx - user profile page with ProtectedRoute wrapper
- [x] T056 [P] Create src/app/account/page.tsx - account settings page with ProtectedRoute wrapper
- [x] T057 Create src/app/auth/callback/route.ts - OAuth callback handler with exchangeCodeForSession

## Phase 3.8: Integration with Payment System (T058-T060)

- [x] T058 RLS policies already use auth.uid() from migration 002 - no hardcoded UUIDs (payment service uses customer_email param)
- [x] T059 Update src/app/payment-demo/page.tsx - wrapped with ProtectedRoute component, uses user.id for PaymentHistory
- [x] T060 Update src/app/payment-demo/page.tsx - shows EmailVerificationNotice at top if user.email_confirmed_at is null

## Phase 3.9: Integration Tests (TDD Phase 2) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE POLISH

- [ ] T061 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/sign-up-flow.test.ts (full sign-up journey: form → API → database → email sent)
- [ ] T062 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/sign-in-flow.test.ts (full sign-in journey: form → API → session created → redirect)
- [ ] T063 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/password-reset-flow.test.ts (forgot password → email → reset form → password updated)
- [ ] T064 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/oauth-flow.test.ts (OAuth button → provider redirect → callback → session created)
- [ ] T065 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/protected-routes.test.ts (middleware blocks unauth users, allows auth users)

## Phase 3.10: E2E Tests (Playwright)

- [ ] T066 [P] Create tests/e2e/auth/user-registration.spec.ts (complete registration flow from quickstart.md: sign-up → verify → sign-in)
- [ ] T067 [P] Create tests/e2e/auth/protected-routes.spec.ts (verify protected routes redirect, verify RLS policies enforce payment access, verify cascade delete removes user_profiles/audit_logs/payment_intents)
- [ ] T068 [P] Create tests/e2e/auth/session-persistence.spec.ts (verify Remember Me extends session to 30 days, verify automatic token refresh before expiration, verify session persists across browser restarts)

## Phase 3.11: Accessibility & Security Testing

- [ ] T069 Run Pa11y accessibility tests on all auth pages (pnpm run test:a11y:dev with server running)
- [ ] T070 Verify WCAG AA compliance for all forms (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, error announcements)
- [ ] T071 Run security audit (pnpm audit, verify no OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities)
- [ ] T072 [P] Execute quickstart.md validation steps manually (verify complete user journey: sign-up → verify → sign-in → access payment demo)

## Phase 3.12: Polish & Documentation

- [ ] T073 [P] Update CLAUDE.md with auth patterns (AuthContext usage, ProtectedRoute HOC, OAuth callback handling)
- [ ] T074 [P] Update docs/prp-docs/PRP-STATUS.md to mark PRP-016 as complete
- [ ] T075 Run full test suite (pnpm run test:suite) and verify all tests pass
- [ ] T076 Run type checking (pnpm run type-check) and fix any TypeScript errors
- [ ] T077 Run linter (pnpm run lint) and fix any ESLint warnings
- [ ] T078 Verify Lighthouse scores remain 90+ for all metrics

## Validation Checklist

**Gate: Verify before marking tasks.md complete**

- [x] All contracts (auth-api.yaml, profile-api.yaml) have corresponding contract tests (T013-T020)
- [x] All entities (user_profiles, auth_audit_logs) have migration tasks (T008-T012)
- [x] All components follow 5-file pattern via generator (T030-T039)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T013-T020 before T040-T049, T061-T065 before polish)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path or command
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD phases clearly marked (contract tests T013-T020, integration tests T061-T065, E2E tests T066-T068)
- [x] All 28 functional requirements from spec.md covered by tasks
- [x] All 5 user scenarios from spec.md have corresponding E2E tests

## Success Criteria (from spec.md)

**Functional Requirements**: All 28 FRs implemented via tasks above
**Performance**: 100-1,000 concurrent sessions (validated in T066-T068)
**Security**: Audit logging (T024), rate limiting (T023), RLS enforcement (T012, T067)
**Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance (T069-T070)
**Testing**: Contract tests (T013-T020), integration tests (T061-T065), E2E tests (T066-T068)

## Notes

- **TDD Approach**: All tests written before implementation (contract tests → utilities → integration tests → E2E tests)
- **Component Generation**: NEVER create components manually - always use generator (T030-T039)
- **Commit Frequency**: Commit after each task completion
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks marked [P] can run simultaneously if using multiple terminals or automated task runner
- **Known Issues**: See docs/testing/KNOWN-TEST-ISSUES.md for any test timing issues (none expected for auth)
- **Quickstart Validation**: Execute quickstart.md steps after T068 to manually verify primary user journey
