# Payment E2E `test.skip` Index (#53)

**Regenerated 2026-06-08 (payment-hub refactor).** Indexes every skipped test in
`tests/e2e/payment/` by its **blocker**, so it's clear what must ship before each
can be un-skipped — and that none are skipped without a tracked reason. Line
numbers + reasons are the ground truth in the specs (verified by grepping
`test.skip(true, ...)`), not hand-maintained guesses.

## Summary

`tests/e2e/payment/` contains **23 skipped tests** across 7 spec files. They fall
into these blocker buckets:

| Blocker                             | Count | Unblocked by                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Live provider keys / webhooks       | 5     | Stripe/PayPal **sandbox credentials** set on the deployed functions                                                     |
| Unimplemented route/page (perf)     | 4     | seeded-volume perf testing on `/payment` (history/dashboard perf)                                                       |
| Offline-queue seed fixture          | 4     | an in-page Dexie queue-seed fixture (autonomous; see note)                                                              |
| Unimplemented dashboard/realtime UI | 4     | reconnection UI, batch-update UI, error toast, payment chart                                                            |
| Won't-fix in E2E                    | 2     | FPS measurement + script-bundling (unreliable / covered elsewhere)                                                      |
| Edge-function flow                  | 1     | PayPal cancel only — the Stripe cancel/resume round-trip is covered by `08-subscription-lifecycle.spec.ts` (2026-07-04) |
| Feature not built                   | 2     | offline-queue feature (#1 result), consent-reset feature                                                                |
| Subscription-mgmt page (legacy ref) | 1     | retarget to the `/payment?tab=subscriptions` hub (legacy comment)                                                       |

**Newly covered (2026-07-04, subscription-lifecycle session, #105):**

- **Subscription checkout redirect** — `01-stripe-onetime.spec.ts` gained
  `should redirect to subscription-mode Stripe Checkout` (local-run when
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID` are set;
  CI auto-skip).
- **Cancel/resume lifecycle** — NEW `08-subscription-lifecycle.spec.ts` drives
  the deployed `cancel-subscription` / `resume-subscription` Edge Functions
  against a REAL test-mode Stripe subscription via the
  `seedLiveStripeSubscription` fixture (provisions customer + `pm_card_visa` +
  subscription over plain-fetch Stripe API), asserting provider-side
  `cancel_at_period_end` both ways. Local-only (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` +
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID` + admin client); CI auto-skips. The `02:123`
  cancel stub therefore re-scopes to the PayPal branch (#104).

**Just un-skipped (2026-06-08, payment-hub refactor, no creds):**

- `02` **grace-period countdown** + **duplicate-prevention (23505)** — via the
  `seedIsolatedSubscription` fixture (prior session), now on the hub.
- `06` **live transaction counter**, **payment-list live update**, **subscription
  status change in real-time**, and a **realtime connection-status indicator** —
  enabled by the new `/payment` hub + the `usePaymentResultsRealtime` /
  `useSubscriptionsRealtime` hooks. They seed a throwaway user + payment/sub row
  via `seedIsolatedPayment` / `seedIsolatedSubscription`, assert the live update,
  and tear down. Guarded with `test.skip(!getAdminClient())`.

**Key takeaways for un-skipping the remaining 23:**

- **5 need live sandbox credentials.** The Edge Functions are deployed; the only
  gate is setting provider secrets (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
  `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`) via the Management API `/secrets`.
- **4 offline-queue tests need a Dexie seed fixture** (client-side
  `PaymentQueueV2`/`queuedOperations` store; must seed IndexedDB in-page via the
  app's `paymentQueue` API). Autonomous but non-trivial — deferred.
- **4 dashboard/realtime UI tests** are genuinely unbuilt widgets (reconnection
  button, batch-update grouping, error toast, payment chart) — deliberately out
  of scope for the template (no clear user need; a chart adds a dependency).
- **4 perf tests** assert load behaviour with large seeded volumes on the
  (now-existing) `/payment` surfaces — separate perf concern, not creds.
- **2 won't-fix** (FPS unreliable in E2E, bundling needs Stripe).

> Note: the payment Edge Functions are all DEPLOYED to prod (Supabase Management
> API). Remaining payment blockers are **sandbox creds** + a few **unbuilt
> widgets**, not backend code.
