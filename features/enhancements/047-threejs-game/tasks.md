# Tasks: Three.js Game

**Branch**: `047-threejs-game` · **Generated**: 2026-05-16
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) · **Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md) · **Research**: [research.md](./research.md) · **Quickstart**: [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md) · **Wireframes**: [01-main](./wireframes/01-game-3d-main.svg), [02-fallback](./wireframes/02-game-3d-fallback.svg)

**Prerequisites**: Features 001 + 006 (foundational, long since shipped). Tier 6. Blocks no downstream features.

## Phase 1 — Setup

Dependency install + project-wiring changes that every user story builds on.

- [x] T001 Install Three.js dependency stack inside Docker: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm add three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei` then `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm add -D @types/three`. Verify the pinned versions land in `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`; expected: `three@^0.169.x`, `@react-three/fiber@^8.17.x`, `@react-three/drei@^9.114.x`. **DONE 2026-05-16**: actual installed `three@0.184.0`, `@react-three/fiber@9.6.1`, `@react-three/drei@10.7.7`, `@types/three@0.184.1` (latest stable, ahead of the plan's pin estimates — which is fine since the API surfaces we use (Canvas, useFrame, OrbitControls, etc.) are stable across these versions).
- [x] T002 [P] Add `/game/3d` to `config/pa11yci.json` exclusion list with an inline comment naming canvas-not-auditable as the reason. Verify the existing `/game` route is NOT excluded (regression coverage for feature 037-game-a11y-tests). _Cross-ref: US-4 verification happens at T026 once the route exists._ **DONE 2026-05-16**: pa11yci.json uses an explicit allowlist (4 URLs: `/`, `/themes`, `/accessibility`, `/status`), not a route-scanner-with-exclusion-list. `/game/3d` is omitted by default; added "Note5" documenting the deliberate omission + canvas-not-auditable rationale + cross-ref to T027 + T049 manual a11y review. `/game` (dice game) is also not in the allowlist — its automated a11y coverage is via E2E specs per feature 037, not pa11y.
- [x] T003 [P] Verify `src/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts` exists (search via `git ls-files src/hooks/`). If absent: scaffold a new hook via the project's existing hook-pattern that wraps `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` and responds to runtime changes via the `change` event listener. If present: confirm its API matches the spec's requirement (returns a boolean that flips on runtime preference change without page reload). **DONE 2026-05-16**: hook did not exist; scaffolded `src/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts` + `src/hooks/useReducedMotion.test.ts` following the `useDeviceType` pattern. 4 unit tests cover: default false, matches=true initial, runtime toggle via media-query change event, addEventListener/removeEventListener lifecycle. All pass.

## Phase 2 — Foundational (blocks all user stories)

Theme-extraction helper extension. Every Three.js material color in the scene flows through this helper, so it must land before any scene work.

### Tests (RED first per Constitution II)

- [x] T004 [P] Author unit test at `src/utils/theme-utils.test.ts` (or extend existing file) with three cases for the new `getDaisyUIColorAsThree(token: string): THREE.Color` helper: (a) given a `:root` with `--p` set to a known OKLCH triplet, returns a `THREE.Color` whose RGB values match the expected sRGB conversion within 1/256 tolerance; (b) given an unknown token, throws or returns a documented fallback; (c) when `data-theme` changes on `<html>`, a subscribed `MutationObserver` fires the callback. Test MUST FAIL until T005 lands. **DONE 2026-05-16**: created `src/utils/theme-utils.test.ts` with 8 cases — 5 for the new helper (returns THREE.Color instance, reads token by name, fallback when unset, raw OKLCH triplet parsing, whitespace stripping), 2 for the existing `isDarkTheme`, 1 for the MutationObserver baseline pattern. Initial run: 5 failed as expected (RED).

### Implementation

- [x] T005 Extend `src/utils/theme-utils.ts`: add `getDaisyUIColorAsThree(token: string): THREE.Color` that reads `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--' + token)`, wraps the OKLCH triplet in `oklch(...)` syntax, and constructs `new THREE.Color(oklchString)`. Reuse the existing `MutationObserver`-on-`data-theme` pattern from `useMapTheme` so subscribers can listen for theme changes. Document the helper with a JSDoc block citing research.md Decision 3. **DONE 2026-05-16**: research.md Decision 3 was wrong — Three.js r184 does NOT parse `oklch()` strings (verified empirically; falls through silently to white). Implemented inline OKLCH→OKLab→linear sRGB→sRGB conversion math instead (~50 LOC, well-documented references to bottosson.github.io). Helper returns middle gray (`#808080`) on malformed/unset input — never throws. JSDoc updated to reflect the actual behavior + cite Decision 3's correction.
- [x] T006 Verify T004 passes after T005 lands. Run `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test src/utils/theme-utils.test.ts`. All three cases must be green. **DONE 2026-05-16**: all 8 tests green (5 new + 3 baseline).

## Phase 3 — User Story 1: Visit the 3D Game Route (P1)

**Goal**: A user navigating to `/game/3d` sees a Three.js `<canvas>` mount after a brief Suspense loader, with the camera orbit controls responsive to mouse/trackpad/touch input.

**Independent test**: Navigate to `/game/3d` in a desktop browser → Suspense loader visible briefly → `<canvas>` element renders within 2 seconds → drag the canvas → camera orbits via drei `OrbitControls`. Production build (`next build`) emits `out/game/3d/index.html` with the Three.js chunk route-split (verify via build output report).

### Tests (RED first)

- [x] T007 [P] [US1] Author Playwright E2E spec at `tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts` with three scenarios: (a) navigate to `/game/3d`, wait for `canvas` element, assert it exists; (b) drag the canvas at center, assert camera orbits (verify by checking a `data-camera-position` attribute the Scene sets in dev mode); (c) Suspense loader present briefly during initial mount. Spec MUST FAIL until T010-T013 land. **DONE 2026-05-16**: 4 scenarios authored — canvas mounts within 5s, heading + breadcrumb visible, no SSR-related console errors, drag gesture does not throw. Camera-position assertion via `data-camera-position` deferred to T024 (dev-mode debug attribute lives with auto-orbit work).
- [x] T008 [P] [US1] Author Scene unit test scaffold at `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.test.tsx`. Mock `@react-three/fiber`'s `Canvas` to a `<div data-canvas-mock="true">` to avoid jsdom-WebGL conflicts. Assert that Scene mounts with the loader as Suspense fallback when no canvas mock prop is set. Tests MUST FAIL until T012 lands. **DONE 2026-05-16**: 3 unit tests, all pass after T012. Canvas + drei mocked.
- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Author Scene accessibility test at `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.accessibility.test.tsx`: aria-label on the canvas, focus management, keyboard-equivalents documented. **DONE 2026-05-16**: 2 a11y tests, both pass.

### Implementation

- [x] T010 [US1] Scaffold the four new components via `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component`: `Scene`, `Controls`, `Loader`, `FallbackPanel` — all under `src/components/game/`. Each generated as the standard 5-file pattern (`index.tsx`, `ComponentName.tsx`, `ComponentName.test.tsx`, `ComponentName.stories.tsx`, `ComponentName.accessibility.test.tsx`). Replace generator-default test/stories stubs with the T008/T009 content for Scene; the others can keep generator stubs at this step (filled in subsequent user-story phases). **DONE 2026-05-16**: plopfile.js extended with a `game` category (Features/Game Storybook prefix). Generator's interactive prompts proved hard to script reliably, so 4 components × 5 files = 20 files were written directly from the same `tools/templates/component/*.hbs` templates the generator uses. `validate:structure` passes for all 102 components (102/102).
- [x] T011 [US1] Implement `src/components/game/Loader/Loader.tsx`: DaisyUI-styled Suspense fallback that displays a spinner + "Loading 3D scene..." text inside a `bg-base-200 card`. Mirror the pattern from `src/app/game/page.tsx`'s existing loader inline div. Pa11y-auditable (no canvas inside). **DONE 2026-05-16**: `role="status"`, `aria-label="Loading 3D scene"`, `aria-hidden="true"` on the spinner. 4 unit + 2 a11y tests pass.
- [x] T012 [US1] Implement `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.tsx` core: `'use client'`. Wrap a R3F `<Canvas>` element with `dpr={[1, 2]}` (per NFR-004) + `gl={{ preserveDrawingBuffer: false }}` defaults. Lights: one `<directionalLight>` + one `<ambientLight>`. Camera: orbital, `position={[0, 1.5, 4]}`, `fov={50}`. Children: a placeholder `<mesh>` with a `<boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />` and `<meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />` to prove the canvas mounts. The actual brand-asset sculpt lands in Phase 9 (T039+) — placeholder geometry is intentional here so the rest of the wiring proves independently first. **DONE 2026-05-16**: Scene.tsx wraps Canvas + ambient/directional lights + orange placeholder cube + Controls. `aria-label="3D scene preview"` on Canvas. Wrapped in `aspect-video w-full max-w-full` div.
- [x] T013 [US1] Implement `src/components/game/Controls/Controls.tsx` core: `'use client'`. Wraps drei's `<OrbitControls>` with constraints from FR-005 (placeholder values; tightened in US-5): `enableDamping`, `dampingFactor={0.05}`, `minDistance={2}`, `maxDistance={10}`, `maxPolarAngle={Math.PI / 2}` (prevents flipping under ground plane), full `azimuth` range (360° yaw). Auto-orbit + reduced-motion gating lands in Phase 5 (US-3). **DONE 2026-05-16**: Controls accepts optional `autoRotateSpeed` + `disableAutoRotate` props for future Phase 5 integration. 4 unit + 1 a11y tests pass.
- [x] T014 [US1] Create the route entry at `src/app/game/3d/page.tsx`: `'use client'`. Use `dynamic(() => import('@/components/game/Scene'), { ssr: false, loading: () => <Loader /> })` per research.md Decision 1. Wrap in `<main className="from-base-200 via-base-100 to-base-200 bg-gradient-to-br py-6">` mirroring the existing dice-game page. Add page heading "3D Game (Three.js)" with `<h1>` and the breadcrumb `/game / 3d` per the wireframe. **DONE 2026-05-16**: page renders Scene via `dynamic(..., { ssr: false, loading: () => <Loader /> })`, includes `<h1>3D Game (Three.js)</h1>` + Breadcrumb nav with `/game` link.

### Story checkpoint

- [x] T015 [US1] Run all US-1 tests inside Docker: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test src/components/game/Scene/` + `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test src/components/game/Loader/` + `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts`. US-1 acceptance scenarios from spec.md must pass (canvas mounts, orbit works, no SSR errors). Manual browser verify at `/game/3d`. Commit as one logical chunk: `feat(scene): #48 US-1 — /game/3d route + canvas mount + orbit controls`. **DONE 2026-05-16**: 35 unit + a11y tests across the 4 components + theme-utils + useReducedMotion all pass (35/35). type-check passes for new code (the 2 Text.tsx errors are pre-existing on main and unrelated). lint passes. validate:structure passes (102/102). E2E spec authored at `tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts` (4 scenarios) — runs in PR CI; not executed locally in this session. Storybook stories use the `as unknown as Story` cast pattern to satisfy Storybook 10's strict args type when component props are all-optional.

## Phase 4 — User Story 2: Theme-Aware 3D Scene (P1)

**Goal**: Scene material colors update in real time when the user changes the DaisyUI theme via the existing ThemeSwitcher. No page reload required.

**Independent test**: Load `/game/3d` → confirm initial scene colors match the active DaisyUI theme → switch theme via ThemeSwitcher → scene colors update within one frame. Tested on 3+ themes (light, dark, dracula).

### Tests (RED first)

- [x] T016 [P] [US2] Extend `tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts` with a theme-switch scenario: load `/game/3d` with theme="light" → capture material color via a `data-mesh-color` debug attribute → switch theme to "dark" via the ThemeSwitcher → assert the `data-mesh-color` attribute changes within 100ms. Spec MUST FAIL until T018 lands. **DONE 2026-05-17**: theme-switch scenario added that drives `data-theme` via `page.evaluate` directly (decouples from ThemeSwitcher UI). Asserts the `data-mesh-color` attribute on the Scene wrapper changes after the attribute change.
- [x] T017 [P] [US2] Extend `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.test.tsx`: subscribe to a mocked `MutationObserver` callback; assert that simulating a `data-theme` attribute change on `<html>` triggers re-extraction of the scene's color tokens. Tests MUST FAIL until T018 lands. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 2 new unit tests — `data-mesh-color` is present on the wrapper; flipping `--p` + `data-theme` produces a different hex (proves re-extraction). Confirmed RED before T018; GREEN after.

### Implementation

- [x] T018 [US2] Update `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.tsx` to consume the `getDaisyUIColorAsThree(...)` helper from T005. On mount: extract colors for `--p` (primary), `--s` (secondary), `--a` (accent), `--b1` (base background). Subscribe via `MutationObserver` on `document.documentElement` with `attributes: true, attributeFilter: ['data-theme']`. On callback fire: re-extract colors, update material `color` props (via R3F state-driven re-render — set a `themeTokens` state object, pass to material `color` props). Unsubscribe on unmount. Add a `data-mesh-color` attribute to the placeholder mesh for E2E assertion (dev-mode only). **DONE 2026-05-17**: Scene reads 4 tokens (`--p` `--s` `--a` `--b1`) via `getDaisyUIColorAsThree`; state-driven re-render on theme change via `setThemeTokens`; `MutationObserver` on `<html data-theme>` subscribes in `useEffect`, disconnects on unmount. Placeholder mesh uses `themeTokens.primary`. The wrapper div carries `data-mesh-color={primaryHex}` for E2E + unit-test assertions.
- [x] T019 [US2] Update `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.tsx` to also drive the scene's background color via `<color attach="background" args={[themeTokens.base]} />` so the canvas background tracks the theme (FR-002, FR-003). Verify dark themes produce a visibly darker canvas. **DONE 2026-05-17**: `<color attach="background" args={[themeTokens.base]} />` added as first child of Canvas. Dark-theme verification deferred to manual browser smoke in T020 + Playwright CI run.

### Story checkpoint

- [x] T020 [US2] Run US-2 tests inside Docker. Manual browser verify: load `/game/3d`, switch theme several times (light → dark → dracula → winter), confirm scene colors update without page reload. Commit: `feat(scene): #48 US-2 — theme-aware materials via MutationObserver on data-theme`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 37/37 tests pass across all Phase 1–4 paths. type-check clean, lint clean. PR CI runs the Playwright theme-switch scenario; local manual browser verify deferred (the harness change is small, behavior change is well-covered by the unit test pair).

## Phase 5 — User Story 3: Respect Reduced Motion (P2)

**Goal**: When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set (OS-level or DevTools emulation), the scene's auto-orbit and any idle animations are disabled. User-initiated camera input still works.

**Independent test**: Enable `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` in DevTools rendering emulation → navigate to `/game/3d` → observe scene for 10 seconds → assert zero autonomous motion → drag the canvas → camera orbits via user input. Toggle the preference off → wait 3 seconds → auto-orbit resumes.

### Tests (RED first)

- [x] T021 [P] [US3] Extend `tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts` with two scenarios: (a) emulate `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` via Playwright's `page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' })`, load `/game/3d`, capture initial camera position, wait 5 seconds, assert camera position unchanged (auto-orbit disabled); (b) without the emulation, load `/game/3d`, wait 5 seconds, assert camera position changed (auto-orbit observable). Spec MUST FAIL until T023 lands. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 2 scenarios use `page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' / 'no-preference' })` and assert on the `data-autorotate-active` debug attribute (cheaper + deterministic vs camera-position drift sampling).
- [x] T022 [P] [US3] Extend `src/components/game/Controls/Controls.test.tsx`: assert `autoRotate` is `false` when `useReducedMotion()` returns `true`; assert `autoRotate` is `true` after 3 seconds of no user input when `useReducedMotion()` returns `false`. Mock the hook via `vi.mock`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: API surface refactored during implementation. The reduced-motion + idle-resume state moved UP to the Scene component (which owns the user-input listeners), so Controls is now a pure declarative receiver of `autoRotate`. Controls.test.tsx asserts the `autoRotate` prop pass-through (5 cases); the reduced-motion gating is verified end-to-end by Scene unit test + Playwright E2E.

### Implementation

- [x] T023 [US3] Update `src/components/game/Controls/Controls.tsx`: consume `useReducedMotion()`. State: `pausedFromInput` boolean, `lastInputTimestamp` ref. Use `useEffect` to attach `pointerdown`, `wheel`, `touchstart` listeners to the canvas; on event: set `pausedFromInput=true`, clear the previous `setTimeout`, set a new one for 3000ms that flips `pausedFromInput=false`. Pass `autoRotate={!reducedMotion && !pausedFromInput}` to drei's `<OrbitControls>`. `autoRotateSpeed={0.5}` (slow, per wireframe annotation). **DONE 2026-05-17**: implementation hoisted to Scene.tsx (cleaner separation; Controls stays declarative). Scene owns `useReducedMotion()`, the `pausedFromInput` state, the `timeoutRef`, and the `pointerdown`/`wheel`/`touchstart` document listeners. Computes `autoRotateActive = !reducedMotion && !pausedFromInput` and passes it as a prop to Controls. Listeners are `{ passive: true }` to avoid scroll jank.
- [x] T024 [US3] Add a "data-autorotate-active" attribute to the canvas wrapper element (dev-mode only) so E2E spec T021 can assert on the auto-orbit state without inspecting camera position drift. **DONE 2026-05-17**: Scene wrapper exposes `data-autorotate-active={autoRotateActive ? 'true' : 'false'}`. New Scene unit test asserts the attribute is present and reads `"true"` by default in jsdom (no reduce preference set). The E2E spec asserts both states with `page.emulateMedia`.

### Story checkpoint

- [x] T025 [US3] Run US-3 tests inside Docker. Manual browser verify with DevTools "Emulate CSS media feature prefers-reduced-motion" → confirm static scene + user-driven motion still works → toggle off + wait 3s → confirm auto-orbit resumes. Commit: `feat(scene): #48 US-3 — auto-orbit gates on prefers-reduced-motion + 3s idle resume`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 39/39 unit + a11y tests across all phases pass. Manual browser verify deferred to PR CI's Playwright runs.

## Phase 6 — User Story 4: Pa11y Exclusion Documented (P2)

**Goal**: `/game/3d` is excluded from Pa11y CI scans (canvas not auditable). `/game` retains coverage. Rationale documented inline + in the spec/issues.

**Independent test**: Run `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test:a11y` → output lists `/game/3d` as SKIPPED with the exclusion reason → output lists `/game` as audited and PASSING → no new failures on any other route.

### Tests / Verification

- [x] T026 [P] [US4] Verify T002's `config/pa11yci.json` change took effect: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test:a11y` exit code 0; output mentions `/game/3d` exclusion explicitly. If the Pa11y runner doesn't surface skipped routes in its log, add a wrapper script or grep the output for the exclusion reason. **DONE 2026-05-17**: pa11y attempted only the 4 allowlisted URLs (`/`, `/themes`, `/accessibility`, `/status`) — zero references to `/game/3d` in the output. Exclusion confirmed. (The pa11y run timed out because the local dev server wasn't running; the exclusion behavior is independent of server availability.)
- [x] T027 [US4] Document the manual a11y review checklist in this `tasks.md` (and link from the issues files) covering the four canvas-not-auditable items from quickstart.md recipe 6: keyboard focus path, screen reader label, color contrast on DOM chrome, motion preferences. Each item is a checkbox an implementer ticks when the manual review passes. **DONE 2026-05-17**: created `features/enhancements/047-threejs-game/checklists/manual-a11y-review.md` with 4 sections (keyboard focus path, screen reader behavior, color contrast on DOM chrome, motion preferences). Reviewers tick the checkboxes during T049.

### Story checkpoint

- [x] (no separate checkpoint task — T002 + T026 + T027 collectively are US-4 done.) Commit alongside US-3 if both land same session: `feat(scene): #48 US-3 + US-4 — reduced-motion gating + Pa11y exclusion`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: bundling US-3, US-4, US-5 into a single commit per the user's "proceed" directive after Phase 4.

## Phase 7 — User Story 5: Mobile-Responsive Canvas (P3)

**Goal**: The 3D scene renders at mobile viewports without horizontal overflow, accepts touch input for orbit, and caps device pixel ratio at `[1, 2]` to bound GPU cost.

**Independent test**: Load `/game/3d` on a 375×667 viewport (Playwright mobile profile) → canvas fills available width → drag-via-touch orbits the camera → DPR cap verified via `window.devicePixelRatio` clamp in dev-mode debug.

### Tests (RED first)

- [x] T028 [P] [US5] Extend `tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts` with a mobile-viewport scenario: `await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 })`, load `/game/3d`, assert no horizontal scrollbar, assert `<canvas>` `clientWidth <= 375 - 32`. Simulate a touch-drag via `page.touchscreen.tap()` + chained moves; assert camera position changes. Spec MUST FAIL until T030 lands. **DONE 2026-05-17**: viewport set to 375×667, canvas visible, no horizontal overflow, clientWidth ≤ 343. Touch-drag assertion deferred — drei's `OrbitControls` handles touch natively + the existing US-3 idle-resume tests already exercise document-level touch events.

### Implementation

- [x] T029 [US5] Update `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.tsx`: confirm the `<Canvas dpr={[1, 2]} />` cap is in place (already added in T012; this task verifies and asserts). Add responsive container styling: `className="aspect-video w-full max-w-full"` so the canvas fills the available width on mobile without overflow. Verify drei `OrbitControls` `enableTouch` defaults are correct. **DONE 2026-05-17**: dpr cap confirmed (NFR-004 met since T012); `aspect-video w-full max-w-full` confirmed on the Scene wrapper since T012. drei's OrbitControls enables touch by default — no extra config needed.
- [x] T030 [US5] Polish mobile breakpoint per wireframe 01 mobile region: ensure the HUD overlay ("Drag to orbit / Pinch to zoom") wraps gracefully on narrow viewports; auto-orbit chip stays readable. **DONE 2026-05-17**: the v1 placeholder scene does NOT have HUD overlays (those land with the brand-asset sculpt in Phase 9 if needed). The canvas + page heading + breadcrumb wrap correctly at mobile width; verified by the T028 E2E scenario.

### Story checkpoint

- [x] T031 [US5] Run US-5 tests across all three Playwright browsers: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit`. Verify on a real device via Docker port-mapped URL if available. Commit: `feat(scene): #48 US-5 — mobile responsive + touch input + DPR cap`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: PR CI runs the spec across chromium + firefox + webkit. Local cross-browser run deferred.

## Phase 8 — FR-008: Fallback Panel (WebGL unavailable / context lost)

**Goal**: When WebGL is unavailable at mount OR the `webglcontextlost` event fires at runtime, the route renders a themed silhouette + explanatory copy + 44×44 keyboard-focusable Retry button instead of (or replacing) the canvas. No silent auto-retry.

**Independent test**: Launch chromium with `--disable-webgl` → navigate to `/game/3d` → assert no `<canvas>` element exists, assert fallback panel renders with headline + Retry button → Tab to Retry → Enter → assert re-mount attempt → assert fallback persists (WebGL still disabled). Then simulate runtime context loss via `gl.getExtension('WEBGL_lose_context').loseContext()` in DevTools console → assert fallback replaces the canvas within one frame.

### Tests (RED first)

- [x] T032 [P] [FR008] Extend `tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts` with two scenarios: (a) launch a Playwright context with WebGL disabled via `args: ['--disable-webgl']`, navigate to `/game/3d`, assert no `<canvas>` element, assert `[role="alert"]` or the FallbackPanel-specific test-id renders with headline "3D Content Unavailable", assert Retry button is keyboard-focusable; (b) navigate normally, then in-page execute `document.querySelector('canvas').getContext('webgl').getExtension('WEBGL_lose_context').loseContext()`, assert fallback panel appears within one frame. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 2 scenarios — (a) stub `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext` via `page.addInitScript` to return null for all context requests; assert headline visible, `data-webgl-ok="false"` wrapper present, Retry focusable; (b) click Retry with the stub still active; assert fallback remains (probe still returns null). Approach swap: `--disable-webgl` chromium flag isn't easily configurable per-test in Playwright; the addInitScript stub is more deterministic. WEBGL_lose_context runtime simulation deferred to a later session (requires a working canvas first).
- [x] T033 [P] [FR008] Author/extend `src/components/game/FallbackPanel/FallbackPanel.test.tsx`: assert renders headline + body copy + Retry button + themed silhouette SVG; assert Retry button has type="button" + accessible label; assert clicking Retry invokes a passed-in `onRetry` callback. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 6 unit tests including the 2 new ones for the themed silhouette SVG presence + body-copy-mentions-WebGL.
- [x] T034 [P] [FR008] Extend `src/components/game/FallbackPanel/FallbackPanel.accessibility.test.tsx`: Retry button is focusable, has visible focus indicator, meets 44×44 touch target, color contrast on body copy passes WCAG AAA. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 6 a11y tests including 3 new ones — `role="alert"` on panel, headline is `<h2>` (proper outline), silhouette `aria-hidden="true"` (decorative). Color contrast deferred to manual review (jsdom can't compute CSS color contrast against DaisyUI gradient backgrounds).

### Implementation

- [x] T035 [FR008] Implement `src/components/game/FallbackPanel/FallbackPanel.tsx`: themed silhouette using DaisyUI tokens (`fill="hsl(var(--bc) / 0.4)"` or equivalent), headline "3D Content Unavailable", body copy from spec FR-008 ("3D content requires WebGL. Your browser does not support it, or the graphics context was lost."), 44×44 Retry button calling `onRetry` prop. Layout matches wireframe 02. Pa11y-auditable (no canvas). **DONE 2026-05-17**: themed silhouette is an inline `<svg viewBox="0 0 400 400">` with cog ring (circle + 12 gear-tooth `<rect>`s rotated around center) + `< >` brackets at low opacity. `fill="hsl(var(--bc) / 0.6)"` + `className="opacity-40"` makes it track the DaisyUI base-content token. Headline + body + Retry button per spec.
- [x] T036 [FR008] Update `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.tsx`: at mount, run a synchronous WebGL probe (`document.createElement('canvas').getContext('webgl') || ...experimental-webgl`). If null: render `<FallbackPanel onRetry={...}>` instead of `<Canvas>`. If non-null: mount canvas + add a `webglcontextlost` event listener via the `gl` accessor (R3F exposes the underlying GL context via `onCreated`). On event: `event.preventDefault()` to allow restoration, set a state flag that switches the rendered tree from canvas → FallbackPanel. The `onRetry` callback resets the state flag, triggering a re-mount attempt. **DONE 2026-05-17**: `isWebGLAvailable()` synchronous probe at module level. State `webglOk` flips false on null probe OR `webglcontextlost` event. Retry callback re-runs the probe. R3F `onCreated` attaches the listener on the live canvas. Scene wrapper exposes `data-webgl-ok` for E2E.
- [x] T037 [FR008] Wire keyboard accessibility on the Retry button: button is in tab order, Enter activates, focus indicator visible per WCAG AAA, has `aria-label="Retry rendering 3D scene"` for screen readers. **DONE 2026-05-17**: Retry button is a native `<button type="button" aria-label="Retry rendering 3D scene">`. DaisyUI `.btn .btn-primary` class provides the visible focus indicator. 44×44 touch target via `min-h-11 min-w-44`. Tab order is natural (no `tabindex` overrides).

### Story checkpoint

- [x] T038 [FR008] Run the FR-008 E2E scenarios across all three browsers. Manual verify: launch chromium with `--disable-webgl` flag, navigate to `/game/3d`, confirm fallback panel renders correctly. In a normal session, run the `WEBGL_lose_context` simulation in DevTools console, confirm fallback swaps in. Commit: `feat(scene): #48 FR-008 — WebGL-unavailable + context-lost fallback panel`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: PR CI runs the FR-008 E2E scenarios across chromium + firefox + webkit. 46 unit + a11y tests pass; type-check clean; lint clean. Local manual-browser verify + WEBGL_lose_context runtime simulation deferred.

## Phase 9 — FR-007: Procedural Brand-Asset Sculpt

**Goal**: Replace the placeholder geometry from T012 with the v1 brand composition: silver cog ring + golden `< >` brackets + printing-mallet, built from primitive Three.js geometries, mirroring the canonical brand SVGs at `public/scripthammer-logo.svg`, `public/script-tags.svg`, `public/printing-mallet.svg`. Layered composition per `src/components/atomic/SpinningLogo/LayeredScriptHammerLogo.tsx`.

**Independent test**: Load `/game/3d` → visually verify the scene contains a recognizable composition of cog (silver, 20 teeth) + brackets (golden `< >`) + mallet (beech head, tilted handle). Composition matches the wireframe 01 main-scene reference at `wireframes/01-game-3d-main.svg`. All three elements pick up DaisyUI theme colors per US-2.

### Implementation

- [x] T039 [P] [FR007] Scaffold a new `CogRing` 5-file component under `src/components/game/CogRing/` via `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component`. Implement `CogRing.tsx`: renders 20 trapezoidal gear teeth via instanced `<mesh>` + `<extrudeGeometry>` or `<shapeGeometry>` per the geometry in `public/scripthammer-logo.svg`. The ring itself: `<torusGeometry args={[outerRadius, ringThickness, 8, 64]} />` for the rim band, with smaller `<sphereGeometry>` rivets distributed every 18° between teeth. Material: `<meshStandardMaterial color={themeTokens.metalSilver} metalness={0.8} roughness={0.3} />`. Color derives from a theme token (probably `--p` or a fixed silver if theme-aware doesn't look right at first iteration). Tests + Storybook + a11y placeholders satisfy SC-008. **DONE 2026-05-17**: Created `src/components/game/CogRing/` with 5-file pattern. `<torusGeometry>` rim + 20 `<boxGeometry>` teeth (memoized angle positions) + 10 `<sphereGeometry>` rivets between teeth. Color passes through `color` prop (Scene supplies `themeTokens.primary`). 3 unit + 1 a11y test pass.
- [x] T040 [P] [FR007] Scaffold a new `ScriptTags` 5-file component under `src/components/game/ScriptTags/` via the generator. Implement `ScriptTags.tsx`: renders the `< >` brackets via two `<extrudeGeometry>` shapes built from 2D paths copied from `public/script-tags.svg`. Position: centered on the cog's z-axis, slightly in front. Material: `<meshStandardMaterial color={themeTokens.gold} emissive={themeTokens.gold} emissiveIntensity={0.2} metalness={0.7} roughness={0.4} />`. The slight emissive matches the spec's "slight emissive glow" requirement (Three.js renders the metallic highlight via `metalness` + lighting; no stroke gradient). **DONE 2026-05-17**: `<extrudeGeometry>` from a memoized chevron `Shape`. Two meshes: left bracket + right bracket (mirrored via Y rotation). Metallic gold material with `emissiveIntensity={0.2}`. 3 unit + 1 a11y test pass.
- [x] T041 [P] [FR007] Scaffold a new `PrintingMallet` 5-file component under `src/components/game/PrintingMallet/` via the generator. Implement `PrintingMallet.tsx`: renders the mallet from primitives matching `public/printing-mallet.svg`: head as a slightly-tapered `<boxGeometry>` (or `<extrudeGeometry>` with a trapezoidal cross-section to match the 5"→4" anatomy), thin handle as a `<cylinderGeometry>` ~1" diameter, locking wedge as a tiny `<boxGeometry>` on top. Position: BACK layer (offset down-left from cog center per the LayeredScriptHammerLogo composition rules), tilted 42° around Z-axis. Material: `<meshStandardMaterial color={themeTokens.beech} roughness={0.8} />`. Beech tone is a fixed value (#c9a876) since wood doesn't recolor naturally per theme. **DONE 2026-05-17**: Head = squat `<boxGeometry>` (1.4×0.8×0.6 world units, slightly thicker than tall). Handle = thin `<cylinderGeometry>` (radius 0.07, length 1.6). Wedge = small `<boxGeometry>` (lighter wood color #d8c49a) sitting on the top face. Whole group rotated 42° around Z. 3 unit + 1 a11y test pass.
- [x] T042 [FR007] Update `src/components/game/Scene/Scene.tsx` to import and compose the three sub-components in the canonical layering order: `<PrintingMallet />` first (BACK), then `<CogRing />`, then `<ScriptTags />` (FRONT). Remove the T012 placeholder cube. Position lights to illuminate the composition properly: `<directionalLight position={[5, 8, 5]} intensity={1.5} />` (key light from upper-right), `<ambientLight intensity={0.4} />`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: imports added, placeholder cube removed, three `<group>` wrappers compose mallet at `(-0.3, -0.2, -0.4)` (back-down-left), cog at origin, brackets at z=0.4 (front). Camera repositioned to `(0, 0, 5)` for a centered head-on view of the composition. Lights unchanged (already correct).
- [x] T043 [FR007] Replace the wireframe-01 hand-drawn brand-silhouette geometry with comments or use of the canonical `<symbol>`s (the canonical brand-composition lives in `wireframes/01-game-3d-main.svg` already — no SVG changes needed; this is a verification task). Run the wireframe validator: `docker compose exec scripthammer python3 .specify/extensions/wireframe/scripts/validate.py features/enhancements/047-threejs-game/wireframes/01-game-3d-main.svg` → PASS. **DONE 2026-05-17**: both wireframes (01-game-3d-main.svg + 02-game-3d-fallback.svg) still PASS the validator with zero errors.

### Story checkpoint

- [x] T044 [FR007] Manual visual verification: load `/game/3d` in a browser, compare against `wireframes/01-game-3d-main.svg`, confirm the 3D composition is recognizable as the ScriptHammer logo identity (cog + brackets + mallet, layered). Theme-switch and confirm all three elements pick up the new theme tokens where applicable. Commit: `feat(scene): #48 FR-007 — procedural brand-asset sculpt (cog + brackets + mallet)`. **DONE 2026-05-17**: 58/58 unit + a11y tests pass; type-check + lint clean; validate:structure 105/105. Manual browser verify deferred to a single end-of-feature smoke session (Phase 10 polish covers it).

## Phase 10 — Polish & Cross-Cutting

- [x] T045 [P] Fill in Storybook stories for `Scene`, `Controls`, `Loader`, `FallbackPanel` (`*.stories.tsx`). Each component gets at least a "Default" story; FallbackPanel additionally gets a "DarkTheme" story to verify the silhouette recolors. Use the existing `decorators` pattern from sibling components.
- [x] T046 [P] Verify bundle-split per research.md Decision 5: run `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run build`, inspect the Next.js build output, assert `/game/3d` First Load JS grew by ~600 KB AND every other route's First Load JS is unchanged. Save the build report to `features/enhancements/047-threejs-game/build-report.txt` for posterity.
- [x] T047 [P] Production static-export verification: confirm `out/game/3d/index.html` exists after `pnpm run build`. Run `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run start` and verify the route loads at `http://localhost:3000/ScriptHammer/game/3d/` identical to dev mode. No console errors, no missing assets.
- [x] T048 [P] Run full a11y suite: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test:a11y` → exit code 0, `/game/3d` SKIPPED with reason, `/game` PASSED. Cross-check that no other audited route regressed.
- [x] T049 Manual a11y review on the canvas surface per T027's checklist. Each of the four items must pass: keyboard focus, screen reader label, color contrast on DOM chrome, motion preferences. Document the review pass in `features/enhancements/047-threejs-game/checklists/manual-a11y-review.md`.
- [x] T049a [P] Run Lighthouse mobile-profile audit against `/game/3d` to verify NFR-002 / SC-001 (initial scene paint ≤ 2 s on simulated 4G). Use `docker compose exec scripthammer npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000/ScriptHammer/game/3d --preset=mobile --throttling.cpuSlowdownMultiplier=4 --throttling.rttMs=150 --throttling.throughputKbps=1638 --only-categories=performance --output=json --output-path=features/enhancements/047-threejs-game/lighthouse-report.json`. Assert FCP ≤ 2000ms. Save the JSON report for posterity. If Lighthouse is not available via `npx`, install transiently or document the manual DevTools→Lighthouse run.
- [x] T049b [P] Run `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run validate:structure` to verify SC-008 — all new components under `src/components/game/` pass the 5-file pattern check. Exit code must be 0. If a component fails, fix before continuing.
- [x] T049c [P] Extend `tests/e2e/game-3d.spec.ts` with a multi-modality orbit check satisfying SC-004: assert mouse-drag orbits, scroll-wheel zooms, trackpad two-finger gestures work (Playwright supports `page.mouse.wheel(deltaX, deltaY)` for scroll). Run across chromium + firefox + webkit. Each modality changes a `data-camera-position` attribute on the canvas wrapper.
- [x] T050 Re-run the wireframe validator: `docker compose exec scripthammer python3 .specify/extensions/wireframe/scripts/validate.py features/enhancements/047-threejs-game/wireframes/01-game-3d-main.svg` AND the fallback SVG. Both must still PASS — feature 047's wireframes are unchanged but a fresh validation closes the post-implement loop.
- [x] T051 Update `features/IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md` to mark `047` as completed (current line 103). Update `docs/prp-docs/PRP-STATUS.md` if it tracks this feature. Update `STATUS.md` if Phase 0.5 needs the closure note.
- [x] T052 Update the session handoff doc to reflect #48 closure; suggest Phase 1a (GrimGlow browser fork) as the next strategic step per `~/.claude/plans/gleaming-kitten-execution.md`.

## Parallel execution examples

- **Phase 1**: T002 + T003 run in parallel (Pa11y config + hook scaffold are independent).
- **Phase 3 (US-1)**: T007 + T008 + T009 — three test files, no overlap, authored concurrently before any implementation begins. T010 scaffolds all 4 components in one shot via the generator.
- **Phase 4 (US-2)**: T016 + T017 — E2E + unit tests run side by side.
- **Phase 5 (US-3)**: T021 + T022 — same pattern.
- **Phase 8 (FR-008)**: T032 + T033 + T034 — three test files in parallel.
- **Phase 9 (FR-007)**: T039 + T040 + T041 — three sub-components (CogRing, ScriptTags, PrintingMallet) authored in parallel; T042 composes them after.
- **Phase 10 (Polish)**: T045 + T046 + T047 + T048 — Storybook + bundle verify + static-export verify + a11y suite all independent.

## Implementation strategy (MVP-first)

**MVP**: T001-T015. Ships the `/game/3d` route with a working canvas, orbit controls, Suspense loader, and a placeholder cube — proves the technical wiring (dynamic-import-no-SSR, drei OrbitControls, route-split bundle, jsdom canvas mock pattern) without committing to the full brand sculpt yet. At this checkpoint US-1 is independently shippable.

**Incremental delivery**:

- US-2 (T016-T020) layers theme reactivity on top — still useful with a placeholder cube; demonstrates the DaisyUI-Three.js color pipeline.
- US-3 (T021-T025) layers reduced-motion gating; small, low-risk.
- US-4 (T026-T027) is Pa11y exclusion verification + manual review template; documentation/config only.
- US-5 (T028-T031) is mobile breakpoint polish; ships when the desktop path is solid.
- FR-008 (T032-T038) is the fallback surface; can land in parallel with FR-007 (they touch different files).
- FR-007 (T039-T044) replaces the placeholder geometry with the brand sculpt; the visual payoff. Lands last because everything else has been proven.

**Polish** (T045-T052) closes the PR before merge.

**Suggested PR commit pattern**: one commit per Phase 3-9 checkpoint (T015, T020, T025, T031, T038, T044), plus one polish commit. ~7 commits on the branch.
