## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Consent-Gated Analytics (Priority: P0)

As a privacy-conscious user, I need analytics tracking to only begin after I explicitly grant consent so that my browsing behavior is not tracked without my permission.

**Why this priority**: Privacy compliance is non-negotiable. Without consent-gating, the entire feature violates GDPR/privacy requirements and could expose the platform to legal liability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the page without consent, verifying no analytics scripts load, then granting consent and verifying analytics initializes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no consent has been provided, **When** the page loads, **Then** no analytics scripts are loaded or executed
2. **Given** the user grants analytics consent via the cookie banner, **When** the page loads or refreshes, **Then** analytics tracking initializes
3. **Given** the user previously granted consent, **When** they withdraw consent, **Then** analytics tracking stops on the next page load
4. **Given** analytics consent is granted, **When** the user navigates between pages, **Then** tracking continues without re-prompting

---

### User Story 2 - Page View Tracking (Priority: P1)

As a site owner, I need all page views to be tracked so that I can understand user navigation patterns and popular content.

**Why this priority**: Page views are the foundation of analytics. Without this, the entire feature provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating through multiple pages and verifying page_view events appear in analytics reports with correct page information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** analytics consent is granted, **When** a user navigates to any page, **Then** a page view event is recorded
2. **Given** a single-page application navigation occurs, **When** the route changes, **Then** a new page view event is sent
3. **Given** a page view is tracked, **When** the event is recorded, **Then** it includes the page path and page title
4. **Given** the user navigates using browser back/forward, **When** the view changes, **Then** page views are tracked correctly

---

### User Story 3 - Web Vitals Performance Tracking (Priority: P2)

As a site owner, I need Core Web Vitals automatically tracked so that I can monitor real-user performance and identify issues affecting user experience.

**Why this priority**: Performance monitoring provides valuable insights but is not required for basic analytics functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading pages and verifying Web Vitals metrics appear in analytics performance reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** analytics consent is granted, **When** a page fully renders, **Then** Core Web Vitals metrics are measured
2. **Given** Web Vitals are collected, **When** sent to analytics, **Then** they appear in performance reports
3. **Given** the site is in development mode, **When** Web Vitals are measured, **Then** they are also logged to the browser console for debugging
4. **Given** a page has poor performance, **When** vitals are measured, **Then** the actual values are captured accurately

---

### User Story 4 - Custom Event Tracking (Priority: P2)

As a site owner, I need key user interactions tracked as custom events so that I can understand how users engage with specific features.

**Why this priority**: Custom events enhance analytics value but are not required for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing tracked actions (theme change, form submit, etc.) and verifying events appear in real-time analytics reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** analytics consent is granted, **When** a user changes the site theme, **Then** a theme change event is tracked
2. **Given** analytics consent is granted, **When** a user submits a form, **Then** a form submission event is tracked
3. **Given** analytics consent is granted, **When** a user installs the PWA, **Then** a PWA installation event is tracked
4. **Given** analytics consent is granted, **When** an error occurs, **Then** an error event is tracked for monitoring

---

### User Story 5 - Graceful Degradation (Priority: P1)

As a user with an ad blocker, I need the site to function normally even when analytics is blocked so that my browsing experience is not affected.

**Why this priority**: Many users use ad blockers. The site must not break or show errors when analytics cannot load.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling an ad blocker, loading the site, and verifying no errors occur and all functionality works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an ad blocker is active, **When** the page loads, **Then** no errors are thrown or displayed
2. **Given** analytics scripts are blocked, **When** the site attempts to track events, **Then** failures are handled silently
3. **Given** analytics is unavailable, **When** the user interacts with the site, **Then** all other functionality works normally
4. **Given** analytics was previously working, **When** it becomes blocked mid-session, **Then** the site continues functioning

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when consent is granted but the analytics service is unreachable?
  - Events are queued or silently discarded; no errors shown to users

- What happens when the user grants consent on one device but not another?
  - Consent is device-specific; each device/browser maintains its own consent state

- What happens when the consent cookie expires?
  - User is prompted again for consent on next visit

- What happens when analytics scripts load slowly?
  - Page functionality is not blocked; analytics loads asynchronously

- What happens when multiple page views fire rapidly (fast navigation)?
  - Each navigation is tracked; debouncing may be applied to prevent flooding

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Consent Management**

- **FR-001**: System MUST NOT load any analytics scripts until user explicitly grants analytics consent
- **FR-002**: System MUST respect consent withdrawal by stopping all tracking on subsequent page loads

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Analytics scripts never load before explicit user consent (100% compliance)
- **SC-002**: All page navigations are tracked when consent is granted (100% coverage)
- **SC-003**: Web Vitals measurements appear in analytics reports within 24 hours of consent
- **SC-004**: Custom events for theme changes, form submissions, and PWA installs are visible in real-time reports
- **SC-005**: Site maintains current performance scores (no regression in page load metrics)
- **SC-006**: Zero errors thrown when analytics is blocked by ad blockers (graceful degradation)
- **SC-007**: Consent state persists correctly across browser sessions (verified via testing)

---

## Constraints _(optional)_

- Analytics must integrate with the existing cookie consent system (Feature 002)
- Scripts must load asynchronously to preserve performance
- No server-side tracking (static export constraint)

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires Cookie Consent system (Feature 002) for consent management
- Benefits from PWA support (Feature 017) for PWA install tracking

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- Users understand what "analytics consent" means from the consent banner
- The analytics provider's data retention complies with applicable privacy regulations
- Debug/development mode can be detected reliably to enable console logging
- Ad blockers are common and graceful degradation is essential
