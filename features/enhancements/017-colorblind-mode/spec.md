## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Enable Colorblind Assistance (Priority: P0)

As a user with a color vision deficiency, I need to select my specific condition type so that the interface adjusts colors to be distinguishable for my vision.

**Why this priority**: Core accessibility requirement. ~8% of men and ~0.5% of women have color vision deficiencies - this is essential for inclusive design.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling a colorblind mode and verifying that UI elements that were previously indistinguishable become visually distinct.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open accessibility settings, **When** I view colorblind options, **Then** I see all major colorblind types listed with clear descriptions
2. **Given** I select my colorblind type, **When** the mode activates, **Then** color adjustments apply immediately across the entire interface
3. **Given** colorblind mode is active, **When** I view success/error/warning indicators, **Then** they are clearly distinguishable from each other
4. **Given** colorblind mode is active, **When** I navigate any part of the application, **Then** all interactive elements remain clearly visible

---

### User Story 2 - Persistence Across Sessions (Priority: P0)

As a user with colorblind mode enabled, I need my preference to be remembered so that I don't have to re-enable it every time I visit the application.

**Why this priority**: Usability requirement - users should not face repeated friction to use an accessibility feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling colorblind mode, closing the browser, and returning to verify the setting persists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I enable a colorblind mode, **When** I return to the application later, **Then** my colorblind preference is still active
2. **Given** I change my colorblind type, **When** I close and reopen the application, **Then** my latest preference is remembered
3. **Given** I disable colorblind mode, **When** I return later, **Then** the application shows standard colors

---

### User Story 3 - Theme Compatibility (Priority: P1)

As a user with colorblind mode enabled, I need the accessibility adjustments to work regardless of which visual theme I choose, so I can personalize my experience while maintaining accessibility.

**Why this priority**: Users should not be forced to choose between personalization and accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling colorblind mode and switching between multiple themes to verify adjustments persist correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** colorblind mode is active, **When** I switch to a different theme, **Then** colorblind adjustments remain applied
2. **Given** any combination of theme and colorblind mode, **When** I view critical UI elements, **Then** they remain distinguishable
3. **Given** colorblind mode is active on a dark theme, **When** I switch to a light theme, **Then** the colorblind adjustments adapt appropriately

---

### User Story 4 - Pattern Overlays for Enhanced Distinction (Priority: P2)

As a user who needs additional visual cues beyond color, I need optional pattern overlays that add visual patterns to UI elements so I can distinguish them without relying solely on color.

**Why this priority**: Important enhancement for users with severe color vision deficiencies or complete color blindness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling patterns and verifying that success/error/warning states have distinct visual patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** colorblind mode is active, **When** I enable pattern overlays, **Then** status indicators show distinct patterns (stripes, dots, hatching)
2. **Given** patterns are enabled, **When** I view buttons with different states, **Then** each state has a unique pattern
3. **Given** patterns are enabled, **When** I disable them, **Then** the UI returns to color-only indicators
4. **Given** patterns are enabled, **When** viewing the interface, **Then** patterns are subtle and do not overwhelm the content

---

### User Story 5 - Simulation Mode for Testing (Priority: P3)

As a designer or developer, I need to simulate various colorblind types so I can test how my work appears to users with different color vision deficiencies.

**Why this priority**: Development tool for ensuring accessibility - not end-user facing but critical for quality assurance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by activating simulation mode and visually comparing the interface to known colorblind simulation tools.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in simulation mode, **When** I select a colorblind type, **Then** the entire page displays as it would appear to someone with that condition
2. **Given** simulation mode is active, **When** I switch between types, **Then** the change is immediate without page reload
3. **Given** simulation mode is active, **When** I disable it, **Then** normal colors are restored immediately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has multiple vision conditions?
  - User can select the mode that works best for their combination; high contrast is often effective

- What happens when colorblind mode conflicts with user's custom theme?
  - Colorblind adjustments take precedence for accessibility; user is informed

- What happens with images and external content?
  - Colorblind filters apply to application UI only; external images are not modified

- What happens when patterns overlap with existing UI patterns?
  - Pattern overlays are designed to complement, not conflict with, existing UI patterns

- What happens on devices with limited color support?
  - Graceful degradation; patterns provide fallback distinction

- Pattern overlays must be subtle enough not to distract from content
- Must not require external services or network calls

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires theme system to be in place for multi-theme compatibility

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- Users know their colorblind type or can identify it from descriptions
- Browser supports modern color filtering capabilities
- Most users will use one colorblind mode, not switch frequently
- Pattern overlays are supplementary; color adjustments are primary
