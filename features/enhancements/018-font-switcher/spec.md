## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Select Font Family (Priority: P0)

As a user who prefers a specific font style, I need to select from available font options so that all text in the application displays in my preferred typography.

**Why this priority**: Core feature - users must be able to change fonts. Typography preferences significantly impact reading comfort and user satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the font switcher, selecting a font, and verifying all text updates immediately without page reload.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the font selection menu, **When** I view the options, **Then** I see at least 6 different font choices
2. **Given** I select a font, **When** the selection is confirmed, **Then** all text across the application updates immediately
3. **Given** I have selected a font, **When** I navigate to different pages, **Then** my font choice remains applied
4. **Given** any font is selected, **When** combined with any theme, **Then** the layout remains stable without visual disruption

### User Story 2 - Persistence Across Sessions (Priority: P0)

As a user who has customized my font preference, I need my selection to be remembered so I don't have to re-select it every time I visit.

**Why this priority**: Essential usability - users expect their personalization to persist.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a font, closing the browser, returning later, and verifying the preference is still active.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I select a font preference, **When** I return to the application later, **Then** my chosen font is still applied
2. **Given** I change my font preference, **When** I close and reopen the application, **Then** my latest choice is remembered
3. **Given** I reset to default font, **When** I return later, **Then** the default font is used

---

### User Story 3 - Accessibility Font Options (Priority: P1)

As a user with dyslexia or visual impairment, I need specialized accessibility fonts available so I can choose typography that improves my reading experience.

**Why this priority**: Critical for inclusive design. Accessibility fonts significantly improve readability for users with specific needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting accessibility fonts and verifying they render correctly with improved readability characteristics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I view font options, **When** looking at the list, **Then** I see a dyslexia-friendly font option clearly labeled
2. **Given** I view font options, **When** looking at the list, **Then** I see a high-readability font option clearly labeled
3. **Given** I select a dyslexia-friendly font, **When** reading content, **Then** text displays with characteristics that aid dyslexic readers
4. **Given** I select a high-readability font, **When** reading content, **Then** text displays with maximum legibility characteristics

---

### User Story 4 - Font Preview (Priority: P2)

As a user choosing a font, I need to preview how each font looks before selecting it so I can make an informed choice without trial and error.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience by reducing friction in font selection.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the font selector and verifying each option displays in its own font style.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the font selection menu, **When** viewing the options, **Then** each font name is displayed using that font
2. **Given** I hover over or focus on a font option, **When** viewing the description, **Then** I see information about the font's purpose and characteristics
3. **Given** I am comparing fonts, **When** viewing the preview, **Then** I can distinguish between different font styles

---

### User Story 5 - Theme Compatibility (Priority: P1)

As a user who has customized both theme and font, I need my font selection to work correctly with any theme so I can fully personalize my experience.

**Why this priority**: Users expect personalization options to work together without conflicts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting various font and theme combinations and verifying text remains readable and layout is stable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have selected a font, **When** I switch themes, **Then** my font preference remains applied
2. **Given** any combination of font and theme, **When** viewing the interface, **Then** text remains readable with appropriate contrast
3. **Given** I switch fonts while using a dark theme, **When** the font changes, **Then** no visual glitches occur

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's preferred font fails to load?
  - System falls back to a similar font category; user is not blocked from using the application

- What happens when printing the page?
  - Print stylesheet uses appropriate print-friendly fonts

- What happens on devices with limited font support?
  - System gracefully falls back to device default fonts

- What happens when user has OS-level accessibility font preferences?
  - Application respects OS accessibility settings as default

- What happens with very long words or non-Latin scripts?
  - All fonts include appropriate fallbacks for extended character support
