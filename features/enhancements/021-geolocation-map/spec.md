## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View Interactive Map (Priority: P0)

As a user visiting the map page, I need to see an interactive map immediately without being required to share my location, so that I can explore and interact with the map without privacy concerns.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - the map must work without requiring any permissions. Users should never be blocked from using the map due to location preferences.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the map page and verifying it displays with default center, zoom controls work, and pan/drag interaction is smooth.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I visit the map page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see an interactive map centered on a default location
2. **Given** the map is displayed, **When** I use pan gestures or drag, **Then** the map smoothly moves in the corresponding direction
3. **Given** the map is displayed, **When** I use zoom controls or gestures, **Then** the map zooms in/out appropriately
4. **Given** I view the map on mobile, **When** I interact with it, **Then** touch gestures work correctly for pan and pinch-zoom

### User Story 2 - Request Location Permission (Priority: P1)

As a user who wants to see my current location on the map, I need a clear way to grant location permission so that the map can center on where I am.

**Why this priority**: Key feature that adds personalization. Location-aware maps significantly improve user experience for local context.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking the location button, responding to browser permission prompt, and verifying map behavior for granted permissions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the map is displayed, **When** I click "Show my location" button, **Then** the browser displays a location permission dialog
2. **Given** I grant location permission, **When** my location is obtained, **Then** the map centers on my current position
3. **Given** location permission is granted, **When** my position is shown, **Then** a marker appears at my exact location
4. **Given** the map is centered on me, **When** I look at the UI, **Then** I can clearly see which marker represents my location

---

### User Story 3 - Handle Denied Location Permission (Priority: P1)

As a user who denies or has blocked location permission, I need the map to continue functioning normally with clear feedback about the location feature status.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user experience - permission denial must not break the map. Users must understand why location is unavailable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by denying location permission and verifying the map continues to work with appropriate UI feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I deny location permission, **When** I view the location button, **Then** it shows "Location blocked" or similar disabled state
2. **Given** location permission is denied, **When** I continue using the map, **Then** all other features (pan, zoom, markers) work normally
3. **Given** location was previously blocked, **When** I click the location button, **Then** I see an explanation of how to re-enable location access
4. **Given** the browser cannot determine my location, **When** the request times out, **Then** I see a friendly error message

---

### User Story 4 - View Custom Map Markers (Priority: P2)

As a user viewing the map, I need to see custom markers for points of interest so that I can understand what locations are relevant on the map.

**Why this priority**: Important for making the map useful beyond simple location display. Markers provide context and value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading a map with predefined markers and verifying they display correctly with popups.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the map has custom markers defined, **When** the map loads, **Then** all markers are visible at appropriate zoom levels
2. **Given** a marker has popup content, **When** I click the marker, **Then** a popup displays the associated information
3. **Given** multiple markers exist, **When** viewing the map, **Then** I can distinguish between different markers
4. **Given** I click a popup, **When** I click elsewhere, **Then** the popup closes

---

### User Story 5 - Accessible Map Navigation (Priority: P1)

As a user who relies on keyboard navigation or assistive technology, I need to be able to interact with the map using only my keyboard so that the feature is accessible to all users.

**Why this priority**: Accessibility compliance requirement. Maps must be usable by keyboard-only users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by tabbing through map controls and verifying all functionality is keyboard-accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I navigate to the map using Tab key, **When** the map is focused, **Then** I can see a clear focus indicator
2. **Given** the map is focused, **When** I use arrow keys, **Then** the map pans in the corresponding direction
3. **Given** the map is focused, **When** I use +/- keys, **Then** the map zooms in/out
4. **Given** markers are present, **When** I navigate with keyboard, **Then** I can focus on markers and activate their popups

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user is on a slow connection?
  - Map tiles load progressively; skeleton/placeholder shows until tiles render

- What happens when the user's device doesn't support geolocation?
  - Location button is hidden or shows "Not supported"; map functions normally otherwise

- What happens when GPS accuracy is poor?
  - Display location with accuracy radius indicator; explain approximate nature

- What happens when the user is offline after initial load?
  - Previously cached tiles remain visible; location may work if device has GPS

- What happens when the default location is not relevant to the user?
  - Configurable default center allows deployment customization

## Constraints _(optional)_

- Map should work without requiring paid API keys or external service accounts
- Map tiles should use open data sources
- Must work with progressive enhancement (basic map works, enhanced features added)

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires consent compliance for location data (Feature 002)
- Must comply with accessibility standards (Feature 001)

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- Users have browsers that support modern geolocation APIs (fallback for older browsers)
- Typical use case is viewing a map with markers, not complex routing or directions
- Location accuracy varies by device and environment (GPS vs network-based)
- Default location can be configured per deployment
