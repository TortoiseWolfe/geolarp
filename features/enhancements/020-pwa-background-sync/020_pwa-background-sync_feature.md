# Feature: PWA Background Sync

**Feature ID**: 020
**Category**: enhancements
**Source**: ScriptHammer/docs/specs/011-pwa-background-sync
**Status**: Ready for SpecKit (Completed in v_001)

## Description

PWA background sync capability for offline form submissions. Users can submit forms while offline, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored. Uses IndexedDB for persistent storage and Service Worker for background processing.

## User Scenarios

### US-1: Offline Form Submission (P1)

A user filling out a contact form loses internet connection. Instead of failing, the form queues the submission for later.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given user is offline, when form is submitted, then submission is queued
2. Given submission queued, when user sees notification, then it says "Message queued"
3. Given submission queued, when viewing form, then queue size indicator shows

### US-2: Automatic Sync on Reconnection (P1)

When internet connectivity is restored, queued submissions are automatically sent without user intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given queued submissions exist, when connectivity restored, then sync triggers automatically
2. Given sync completes successfully, when finished, then queue is cleared
3. Given sync completes, when user is notified, then they see success message

### US-3: Queue Management UI (P2)

Users can see and manage their pending offline submissions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given queued items exist, when viewing form, then queue count is displayed
2. Given offline status, when viewing form, then offline indicator is shown
3. Given connectivity changes, when status updates, then UI reflects immediately

### US-4: Retry on Failure (P3)

Failed sync attempts are retried with tracking.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given sync fails, when retrying, then retry count is tracked
2. Given max retries exceeded, when checking queue, then item remains for manual handling
3. Given partial success, when some items fail, then only failed items remain queued

## Technical Architecture

### Components

- **offline-queue.ts**: IndexedDB-based queue management
- **background-sync.ts**: Service Worker sync registration
- **useOfflineQueue.ts**: React hook for queue state
- **sw.js**: Service Worker with sync event handlers

### Data Flow

```
Form Submit → Check Online → If Offline → Queue to IndexedDB
                            → Show "Queued" message
                            → Register Background Sync

Connectivity Restored → Sync Event Fires → Process Queue
                     → Send Each Item → Clear on Success
                     → Notify User
```

## Requirements

### Functional

- FR-001: Service Worker implements Background Sync API
- FR-002: Forms queue submissions when offline via IndexedDB
- FR-003: Automatic retry when connection restored
- FR-004: User notification of sync status
- FR-005: Works with existing form validation (Zod)
- FR-006: Integrates with Web3Forms provider
- FR-007: Clear offline indicator in UI
- FR-008: Queue size displayed when items pending

### Non-Functional

- NFR-001: Queue storage < 1MB typical usage
- NFR-002: Sync latency < 500ms after reconnection
- NFR-003: IndexedDB operations < 50ms each
- NFR-004: No impact on online form submission performance

### Browser Compatibility

- Background Sync API: Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge)
- Fallback: Manual sync for Safari, Firefox

### Out of Scope

- Real-time sync progress indicator
- Queue editing/cancellation UI
- Encryption of queued data
- Multi-device queue sync

## Success Criteria

- SC-001: Forms submit successfully while offline
- SC-002: Queued items sync automatically when online
- SC-003: User receives clear feedback at each stage
- SC-004: No data loss during offline periods
- SC-005: Works with Web3Forms integration
- SC-006: 97%+ test coverage maintained
