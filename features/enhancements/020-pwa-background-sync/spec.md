## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Offline Form Submission (Priority: P0)

As a user filling out a form when my internet connection drops, I need my form submission to be saved locally so that my work is not lost and will be sent when connectivity returns.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the feature. Without reliable offline queuing, users lose data and trust in the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by disabling network connectivity, submitting a form, and verifying the submission is queued with appropriate user feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am filling out a form and lose internet connectivity, **When** I submit the form, **Then** my submission is queued locally for later delivery
2. **Given** my submission has been queued, **When** I see the confirmation, **Then** I am clearly informed that my message is saved and will be sent when online
3. **Given** I have pending queued submissions, **When** I view the form area, **Then** I see a count of pending items waiting to sync
4. **Given** I am offline, **When** I view the application, **Then** I see a clear offline indicator

---

### User Story 2 - Automatic Sync on Reconnection (Priority: P0)

As a user with queued form submissions, I need them to be automatically sent when my internet connection is restored so that I don't have to remember to manually resend them.

**Why this priority**: Automatic sync is essential for the seamless offline experience. Manual sync would defeat the purpose of background sync.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by queuing submissions offline, then restoring connectivity and verifying submissions are sent automatically without user action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have queued submissions and my connectivity is restored, **When** the system detects the connection, **Then** sync begins automatically without my intervention
2. **Given** sync completes successfully, **When** all queued items are sent, **Then** the queue is cleared and I receive a success notification
3. **Given** I am using the application when sync completes, **When** notified, **Then** I see a clear message confirming my submissions were delivered
4. **Given** sync happens while I am away from the application, **When** I return, **Then** I can see that my queued items were successfully sent

---

### User Story 3 - Offline Status Awareness (Priority: P1)

As a user, I need clear visual feedback about my connectivity status and pending submissions so that I understand the current state of my data.

**Why this priority**: User confidence requires transparency about what's happening with their data, especially in offline scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling network connectivity and verifying the UI updates immediately to reflect the current status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am online, **When** I lose connectivity, **Then** an offline indicator appears immediately
2. **Given** I am offline, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** the offline indicator disappears and online status is shown
3. **Given** I have queued items, **When** I view the form area, **Then** I see the exact count of pending submissions
4. **Given** connectivity changes, **When** the status updates, **Then** the UI reflects the change within 1 second

---

### User Story 4 - Sync Failure Recovery (Priority: P2)

As a user whose sync attempt fails, I need the system to retry automatically and keep me informed so that my submissions eventually get delivered without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Transient failures are common. Automatic retry with clear feedback ensures eventual delivery without user frustration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating sync failures and verifying retry behavior and user notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a sync attempt fails due to a temporary issue, **When** the system retries, **Then** it attempts delivery again automatically
2. **Given** multiple retry attempts have been made, **When** checking status, **Then** I can see the retry count for pending items
3. **Given** the maximum retry limit is exceeded, **When** the item cannot be delivered, **Then** it remains in the queue with clear indication that manual attention may be needed
4. **Given** some items succeed and some fail, **When** partial sync completes, **Then** only failed items remain in the queue

---

### User Story 5 - Graceful Degradation (Priority: P1)

As a user on a browser that doesn't support background sync, I need an alternative way to sync my submissions so that the feature still works for me.

**Why this priority**: Not all browsers support background sync. A fallback ensures the feature works across the user base.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using a browser without background sync support and verifying manual sync or automatic sync on visibility works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** my browser doesn't support background sync, **When** I queue a submission offline, **Then** it is still stored locally
2. **Given** I have queued items and background sync is unsupported, **When** I return to the application while online, **Then** sync is triggered automatically
3. **Given** automatic fallback sync is not possible, **When** I view the queue, **Then** I have an option to manually trigger sync
4. **Given** I use the manual sync option, **When** sync completes, **Then** I receive the same feedback as automatic sync

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user submits multiple forms rapidly while offline?
  - Each submission is queued independently and processed in order when online

- What happens when the device runs low on storage?
  - System provides warning before storage limit is reached; oldest completed syncs are cleaned up first

- What happens when the user closes the browser before sync completes?
  - Queue persists in local storage; sync resumes on next app visit

- What happens when the sync endpoint is permanently unavailable?
  - After max retries, item remains queued with error state; user is notified to contact support

- What happens when form validation rules change between queue and sync?
  - Submission is sent as-is; server handles validation; rejection results in clear error feedback

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Offline Queue Management**

- **FR-001**: System MUST queue form submissions locally when the device is offline
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist queued submissions across browser sessions
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain submission order in the queue (FIFO)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support queuing multiple form types

**Automatic Synchronization**

- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically initiate sync when connectivity is restored
- **FR-006**: System MUST process queued items in the order they were submitted
- **FR-007**: System MUST remove successfully synced items from the queue
- **FR-008**: System MUST support background sync while the application is not in focus (where browser supports it)

**Retry Logic**

- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically retry failed sync attempts
- **FR-010**: System MUST track retry count for each queued item
- **FR-011**: System MUST stop automatic retry after a configurable maximum attempts (default: 3)
- **FR-012**: System MUST keep failed items in queue for potential manual retry

**User Feedback**

- **FR-013**: System MUST display clear offline/online status indicator
- **FR-014**: System MUST show count of pending queued submissions
- **FR-015**: System MUST notify user when submissions are successfully synced
- **FR-016**: System MUST inform user when sync fails after max retries
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide confirmation when form is queued offline

**Compatibility**

- **FR-018**: System MUST work with existing form validation
- **FR-019**: System MUST integrate with existing form submission handlers
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide fallback for browsers without background sync support
- **FR-021**: System MUST NOT impact online form submission experience

### Key Entities

- **Queued Submission**: Represents a form submission waiting to sync; includes form data, submission timestamp, retry count, status
- **Sync Status**: Represents current sync state; includes connectivity status, queue size, last sync time
- **Sync Result**: Represents outcome of a sync attempt; includes success/failure, items processed, errors encountered

---

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of offline form submissions are queued successfully (no data loss)
- **SC-002**: Queued items sync automatically within 30 seconds of connectivity restoration
- **SC-003**: Users receive feedback for all sync state changes (queued, syncing, success, failure)
- **SC-004**: Queue persists correctly across browser sessions (verified via testing)
- **SC-005**: Fallback sync works on browsers without background sync support
- **SC-006**: Online form submission performance is not degraded (< 50ms overhead)
- **SC-007**: 95%+ of queued submissions eventually sync successfully (excluding permanent server errors)

---

## Constraints _(optional)_

- Queue storage is limited by browser local storage capacity
- Background sync API is only available in Chromium-based browsers; fallback required for others
- Must integrate with existing form infrastructure without breaking changes

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires PWA infrastructure (Feature 017 or similar)
- Must work with existing form validation system
- Integrates with form submission handlers

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- Users have modern browsers with local storage support
- Typical queue size will be small (< 10 items for most users)
- Network connectivity changes can be detected reliably
- Form submission endpoints can handle delayed submissions gracefully
