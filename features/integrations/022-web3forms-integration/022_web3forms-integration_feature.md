# Feature: Web3Forms Email Integration

**Feature ID**: 022
**Category**: integrations
**Source**: ScriptHammer/docs/specs/009-web3forms-integration
**Status**: Complete (2026-04-08) — `src/hooks/useWeb3Forms.ts` with unit tests, `ContactForm` component integrates the hook, form E2E tested in `tests/e2e/form-submission.spec.ts`. Activates when `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` is set (per-fork configuration).

## Description

A contact form integration using Web3Forms as the primary email provider. Provides proper validation, error handling, and user feedback for form submissions without exposing server-side email credentials. Serverless-friendly with no backend configuration required.

## User Scenarios

### US-1: Submit Contact Form (P1)

A user fills out the contact form and submits their inquiry, receiving immediate feedback on submission status.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given a valid form, when user submits, then data is sent to Web3Forms API
2. Given submission successful, when user sees feedback, then they see a success message
3. Given submission failed, when user sees error, then they see a clear error message with retry option

### US-2: Form Validation (P1)

Form fields are validated before submission to prevent invalid data and provide immediate feedback.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given name field, when less than 2 characters, then validation error is shown
2. Given email field, when invalid format, then validation error is shown
3. Given message field, when less than 10 characters, then validation error is shown

### US-3: Honeypot Spam Protection (P2)

The form includes hidden fields to prevent automated spam submissions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given honeypot field, when filled by bot, then submission is silently rejected
2. Given legitimate user, when form submitted, then honeypot is ignored
3. Given spam protection, when active, then it does not affect legitimate users

### US-4: Offline Queue (P3)

When offline, form submissions are queued for later delivery.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given user offline, when form submitted, then it is queued locally
2. Given queued submission, when back online, then submission is retried
3. Given queue exists, when viewing form, then user sees pending count
