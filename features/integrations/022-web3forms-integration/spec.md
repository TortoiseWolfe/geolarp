## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Submit Contact Form (Priority: P0)

As a visitor who wants to contact the organization, I need to submit a contact form so that my inquiry reaches the appropriate recipient.

**Why this priority**: Core feature - users must be able to send messages. This is the primary purpose of a contact form.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by filling out the form with valid data, submitting, and verifying a success message appears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have filled out all required fields correctly, **When** I click submit, **Then** my message is sent and I see a success confirmation
2. **Given** my submission was successful, **When** viewing the confirmation, **Then** I see clear feedback that my message was received
3. **Given** my submission failed, **When** viewing the error, **Then** I see a clear error message explaining what went wrong
4. **Given** a submission error occurred, **When** I want to retry, **Then** I can resubmit without re-entering my data

---

### User Story 2 - Form Validation (Priority: P0)

As a user filling out the contact form, I need immediate feedback on validation errors so I can correct mistakes before submitting.

**Why this priority**: Essential usability - users should know if their input is valid before attempting to submit.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering invalid data in each field and verifying appropriate error messages appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I enter a name with fewer than 2 characters, **When** I move to the next field, **Then** I see a validation error for the name field
2. **Given** I enter an invalid email format, **When** I move to the next field, **Then** I see a validation error for the email field
3. **Given** I enter a message with fewer than 10 characters, **When** I attempt to submit, **Then** I see a validation error for the message field
4. **Given** I have validation errors, **When** I correct them, **Then** the error messages disappear

---

### User Story 3 - Spam Protection (Priority: P1)

As the organization receiving contact form submissions, I need spam protection so that automated bots cannot flood my inbox with junk messages.

**Why this priority**: Important for operational efficiency - reduces noise and ensures legitimate messages are visible.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying hidden spam protection fields are present and that submissions with those fields filled are rejected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an automated bot fills hidden spam detection fields, **When** the form is submitted, **Then** the submission is silently rejected
2. **Given** a legitimate user submits the form, **When** they have not interacted with hidden fields, **Then** their submission proceeds normally
3. **Given** spam protection is active, **When** a legitimate user uses the form, **Then** they experience no interference

---

### User Story 4 - Offline Support (Priority: P2)

As a user who loses internet connectivity while filling out the form, I need my submission to be queued so I don't lose my message.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience - prevents frustration from lost form data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by disconnecting network, submitting form, reconnecting, and verifying submission is automatically sent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am offline, **When** I submit the form, **Then** my submission is saved locally for later delivery
2. **Given** I have a queued submission, **When** I reconnect to the internet, **Then** my submission is automatically sent
3. **Given** I have pending submissions, **When** I view the form, **Then** I see an indicator showing pending message count
4. **Given** my queued submission succeeds, **When** it is sent, **Then** I receive confirmation that my message was delivered

---

### User Story 5 - Accessible Form Experience (Priority: P1)

As a user with accessibility needs, I need the contact form to be fully accessible so I can submit my inquiry using assistive technologies.

**Why this priority**: Required for inclusive design and compliance with accessibility standards.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation to verify all form elements are accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I use a screen reader, **When** I navigate the form, **Then** all fields are properly labeled and described
2. **Given** I use keyboard navigation, **When** I tab through the form, **Then** focus order is logical and visible
3. **Given** a validation error occurs, **When** it is displayed, **Then** screen readers announce the error appropriately
4. **Given** the form submission status changes, **When** success or error occurs, **Then** the status is announced to assistive technologies

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the submission service is unavailable?
  - User sees a friendly error message with option to retry or queue for later

- What happens when the user submits the same form multiple times quickly?
  - Duplicate submissions are prevented; submit button is disabled during processing

- What happens when the user navigates away with unsaved form data?
  - Browser prompts user to confirm leaving to prevent data loss

- What happens when a very long message is submitted?
  - Message is truncated at a reasonable limit with user notification

- What happens when special characters are in the message?
  - All input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks while preserving meaning
