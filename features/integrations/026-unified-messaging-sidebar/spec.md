**Tracking**: see gap-audit GitHub issues + STATUS.md

### Shipped

### Gaps

- Mobile drawer transitions need polish
- Real-time badge count sync has latency

### Notes

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Message an Accepted Connection (Priority: P1)

As a user with accepted connections, I can click "Message" next to any connection to immediately start a conversation.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - reduces friction from multi-page flow to single-click messaging.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accepting a connection and clicking Message to verify conversation opens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an accepted connections list, **When** "Message" is clicked, **Then** a conversation opens immediately
2. **Given** no prior conversation exists, **When** messaging is initiated, **Then** a new conversation is created
3. **Given** an existing conversation exists, **When** "Message" is clicked, **Then** the existing conversation opens (no duplicate created)
4. **Given** messaging initiation, **When** operation is in progress, **Then** a loading indicator shows on the button

### User Story 2 - Unified Tab Navigation (Priority: P2)

As a user, I can see chats, connections, and user search in a single sidebar with tabs.

**Why this priority**: Core navigation pattern - consolidates multiple pages into unified interface.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking each tab and verifying correct content displays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the messages page, **When** "Chats" tab is clicked, **Then** existing conversations list is displayed
2. **Given** the messages page, **When** "Connections" tab is clicked, **Then** pending and accepted connections are shown
3. **Given** the messages page, **When** "Find People" tab is clicked, **Then** user search interface is shown
4. **Given** tab switching, **When** returning to a previous tab, **Then** scroll position is preserved

---

### User Story 3 - Mobile Drawer Pattern (Priority: P3)

As a mobile user, I can access the sidebar as a full-screen drawer that opens and closes.

**Why this priority**: Mobile accessibility - ensures full functionality on smaller screens.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by resizing viewport to mobile width and verifying drawer behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** mobile viewport (under 768px), **When** messages page opens, **Then** sidebar is displayed as full-screen view
2. **Given** sidebar on mobile, **When** a conversation is tapped, **Then** sidebar closes and chat becomes full-screen
3. **Given** chat on mobile, **When** back button is tapped, **Then** sidebar drawer reopens
4. **Given** desktop viewport (768px or wider), **When** messages page opens, **Then** sidebar and chat are side-by-side

---

### User Story 4 - Consolidated Entry Point (Priority: P4)

As a user navigating legacy URLs, I am automatically redirected to the unified messages page.

**Why this priority**: Consistency - prevents confusion from multiple entry points.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visiting legacy URLs and verifying redirect to unified page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a legacy connections URL is visited, **When** page loads, **Then** redirect to messages page with connections tab active
2. **Given** a legacy conversations URL is visited, **When** page loads, **Then** redirect to messages page with chats tab active
3. **Given** an invalid tab parameter, **When** page loads, **Then** default to "chats" tab silently

### Edge Cases

- What if user clicks Message on a connection that was just declined?
  - Verify connection status is "accepted" before allowing; show error if not connected

- What if two users try to message each other simultaneously?
  - Use canonical ordering (consistent participant ordering) to prevent duplicate conversations

- What if network fails during conversation creation?
  - Show error message with retry option; button returns to ready state

- What if user navigates away while conversation is being created?
  - Cancel pending operation; no partial state left behind

- What if tab content is stale after being inactive?
  - Background refresh of cached data when tab inactive over 30 seconds

- What if badges show outdated counts?
  - Real-time updates ensure badge counts reflect current state

- What if mobile drawer is open when viewport resizes to desktop?
  - Gracefully transition to side-by-side layout

- What if user rapidly switches between tabs?
  - Debounce tab switches; show last selected tab content without flickering

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_
