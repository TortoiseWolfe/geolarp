## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - One-Time Payment (Priority: P0)

As a customer, I need to make a one-time payment for a donation or product purchase so that I can complete my transaction securely.

**Why this priority**: Core revenue functionality - enables the business to accept payments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing a payment flow and verifying the transaction is recorded with correct amount and status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I click the payment button, **When** I have granted consent, **Then** I am redirected to the payment page
2. **Given** payment is completed, **When** confirmation is received, **Then** my payment is marked as verified
3. **Given** payment fails, **When** an error occurs, **Then** I see a clear error message with a retry option
4. **Given** I select a payment amount, **When** viewing options, **Then** I can choose from preset amounts or enter a custom amount

---

### User Story 2 - Subscription Payment (Priority: P0)

As a customer, I need to subscribe to a recurring plan so that I receive ongoing access to premium features without manual renewal.

**Why this priority**: Core recurring revenue - enables sustainable business model.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by subscribing and verifying billing date tracking and automatic renewal attempts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I select a subscription plan, **When** payment is authorized, **Then** recurring billing is configured
2. **Given** my subscription is active, **When** the billing date arrives, **Then** payment is automatically charged
3. **Given** a payment fails, **When** the retry schedule triggers, **Then** the system retries on a configured schedule
4. **Given** I want to cancel, **When** I request cancellation, **Then** my subscription stops at the end of the current period

---

### User Story 3 - Payment Consent Flow (Priority: P1)

As a privacy-conscious user, I need to consent before payment provider scripts are loaded so that my privacy is protected and regulatory requirements are met.

**Why this priority**: Legal compliance - GDPR requires consent before loading third-party scripts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visiting payment page and verifying consent modal appears before any payment scripts load.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I visit the payment page for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** a consent modal appears
2. **Given** I grant consent, **When** I close the modal, **Then** payment scripts load and I can proceed
3. **Given** I decline consent, **When** viewing payment options, **Then** I see alternative payment methods that don't require scripts
4. **Given** I previously declined, **When** I return later, **Then** I am prompted for consent again

---

### User Story 4 - Payment Verification (Priority: P1)

As a business owner, I need payments to be verified through secure callbacks so that fraudulent transactions are detected and rejected.

**Why this priority**: Security and trust - ensures only legitimate payments are processed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending valid and invalid payment callbacks and verifying correct handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a payment callback is received, **When** the signature is valid, **Then** the payment is processed
2. **Given** an invalid signature, **When** a callback is received, **Then** it is rejected
3. **Given** a duplicate callback, **When** processing, **Then** it is handled without creating duplicate records
4. **Given** a callback fails processing, **When** retried, **Then** it succeeds on subsequent attempts

---

### User Story 5 - Subscription Retry Logic (Priority: P1)

As a subscription holder, I need the system to automatically retry failed payments so that my service isn't interrupted due to temporary payment issues.

**Why this priority**: Revenue protection - reduces involuntary churn from temporary payment failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating payment failures and verifying retry attempts occur on schedule.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a subscription payment fails, **When** the first retry is scheduled, **Then** retry occurs after a short delay
2. **Given** retries continue to fail, **When** the schedule progresses, **Then** delays between retries increase
3. **Given** all retries are exhausted, **When** the grace period begins, **Then** the subscription enters a grace state
4. **Given** the grace period expires, **When** no successful payment occurs, **Then** the subscription is cancelled

---

### User Story 6 - Offline Payment Queuing (Priority: P2)

As a user in an area with unreliable connectivity, I need my payment operations to be queued when offline so that I can complete transactions when connectivity is restored.

**Why this priority**: Resilience - ensures payments aren't lost due to temporary connectivity issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by initiating payment while offline and verifying it processes when connectivity returns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the payment service is unavailable, **When** I initiate a payment, **Then** the operation is queued locally
2. **Given** connectivity is restored, **When** the queue syncs, **Then** pending operations are processed
3. **Given** I am offline, **When** viewing the payment UI, **Then** I see an offline indicator
4. **Given** I close the browser while offline, **When** I return online, **Then** queued operations are still pending

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a payment provider is temporarily unavailable?
  - System fails over to an alternate provider if configured; otherwise queues the operation

- What happens when a subscription payment fails after all retries?
  - Subscription enters grace period with limited access, then cancels after grace expires

- What happens when duplicate payment callbacks arrive?
  - System processes the first callback and ignores duplicates (idempotent handling)

- What happens when a user disputes a payment?
  - Payment is marked as disputed and business owner is notified for manual resolution

- What happens when currency conversion is needed?
  - System displays amounts in user's preferred currency where supported
