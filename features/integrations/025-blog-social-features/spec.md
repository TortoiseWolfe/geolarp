## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Share Blog Post (Priority: P1)

A reader finds a valuable blog post and wants to share it with their network on social media platforms.

**Why this priority**: Core feature value - sharing drives traffic and engagement. Without sharing capability, the social integration has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Click share button for each platform, verify correct URL and metadata is passed to the platform's share interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a blog post with share buttons visible, **When** user clicks a share button, **Then** the selected platform's share interface opens
2. **Given** share interface opens, **When** user views pre-populated content, **Then** post title, description, and URL are correctly included
3. **Given** user completes sharing, **When** followers click the shared link, **Then** they arrive at the full blog post

---

### User Story 2 - View Author Profile (Priority: P1)

A reader wants to learn more about the author of a blog post and potentially connect with them on social media.

**Why this priority**: Author credibility and connection builds reader trust and engagement. Essential for content-driven sites.

**Independent Test**: View author section on a blog post, verify bio displays and all social links are functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a blog post with an author, **When** viewing the author section, **Then** author name, bio, and avatar are visible
2. **Given** author has social links configured, **When** clicking a social link, **Then** the link opens in a new tab
3. **Given** author has no social links configured, **When** viewing author section, **Then** only name and bio are shown (no empty link containers)

---

### User Story 3 - Rich Social Previews (Priority: P2)

When blog posts are shared on social platforms, they should display rich previews with images and descriptions rather than plain URLs.

**Why this priority**: Enhances shareability and click-through rates, but posts are shareable without this feature.

**Independent Test**: Share post URL to Twitter/LinkedIn preview tools, verify Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata renders correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** post is shared to Twitter/X, **When** link preview renders, **Then** Twitter Card displays featured image, title, and description
2. **Given** post is shared to LinkedIn or Facebook, **When** link preview renders, **Then** Open Graph metadata displays correctly
3. **Given** post has no featured image, **When** shared, **Then** default site image is used for preview

---

### User Story 4 - Accessible Sharing (Priority: P2)

Sharing functionality must be accessible to all users, including those using screen readers, keyboard navigation, or with JavaScript disabled.

**Why this priority**: Essential for WCAG compliance and inclusive design, but core sharing works for most users.

**Independent Test**: Navigate share buttons with keyboard only and screen reader, verify all are accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** share buttons are rendered, **When** screen reader reads the page, **Then** proper ARIA labels announce each platform name
2. **Given** JavaScript is disabled, **When** user attempts to share, **Then** fallback copy-link functionality works
3. **Given** user navigates with keyboard, **When** tabbing through share buttons, **Then** all buttons receive visible focus

### Edge Cases

**Missing Author Information**:

- Author not configured for post
- System displays "Anonymous" or omits author section gracefully
- No broken UI or empty containers shown

**Invalid Social URLs**:

- Author's social link URL is malformed or broken
- System validates URLs during build/save
- Invalid URLs are omitted from display with warning in build log

**Platform Unavailability**:

- Social platform's share endpoint is unavailable
- Buttons still function (open platform URL)
- User sees platform's error page, not app error

**Missing Featured Image**:

- Post has no featured image for social preview
- System falls back to default site Open Graph image
- Preview still renders with site branding

**Very Long Titles/Descriptions**:

- Post title exceeds platform character limits
- System truncates appropriately with ellipsis
- Core metadata remains valid

**JavaScript Disabled**:

- User has JavaScript disabled in browser
- Copy-to-clipboard fallback available
- Direct platform share URLs still work as links
