# Feature Specification: Email Service Redundancy

**Feature Branch**: `023-emailjs-integration`
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Status**: Partial
**Input**: User description: "A backup email service that provides redundancy for contact form submissions. Implements automatic failover when the primary email provider fails, ensuring zero message loss with seamless provider switching invisible to users."

<!-- AUDIT-IMPL-STATUS-BEGIN -->

## Implementation Status

**Last audited**: 2026-04-25
**Real status**: Partial
**Tracking**: see gap-audit GitHub issues + STATUS.md

### Shipped

- src/lib/email/ dual-provider abstraction
- Failover logic

### Gaps

- Provider health dashboard not built (admin-only, optional)
- Rate-limit handling incomplete

### Notes

- Foundation works transparently to users; admin UI gaps.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Automatic Failover (Priority: P0)

As a user submitting a contact form, I need my message to be delivered even if the primary email service is unavailable so that my inquiry is never lost.

**Why this priority**: Core feature - ensures message delivery reliability. Users should never experience message loss due to service outages.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating primary provider failure and verifying the backup provider handles submission successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the primary email provider is unavailable, **When** I submit the contact form, **Then** my message is delivered via the backup provider
2. **Given** failover occurs, **When** I see the submission result, **Then** I see a success message (provider switch is invisible to me)
3. **Given** both providers are working, **When** I submit the form, **Then** the primary provider handles my submission
4. **Given** failover succeeds, **When** the primary provider recovers, **Then** future submissions use the primary provider again

---

### User Story 2 - Retry with Intelligent Backoff (Priority: P1)

As the system handling email submissions, I need to retry failed attempts with increasing delays before switching providers so that temporary issues don't trigger unnecessary failovers.

**Why this priority**: Important for reliability - prevents cascading failures from brief network issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating intermittent failures and verifying retry delays increase appropriately before failover.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a provider fails once, **When** retry is triggered, **Then** the system waits before retrying
2. **Given** multiple consecutive failures, **When** retries continue, **Then** delay between attempts increases
3. **Given** maximum retries are exceeded, **When** next attempt occurs, **Then** the system fails over to the backup provider
4. **Given** a retry succeeds, **When** submission completes, **Then** failure count resets for that provider

---

### User Story 3 - Provider Health Monitoring (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I need visibility into email provider health so I can troubleshoot delivery issues and understand system reliability.

**Why this priority**: Operational requirement - enables proactive monitoring and debugging.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by checking provider status after various success/failure scenarios.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a provider fails repeatedly, **When** checking status, **Then** I see that provider marked as degraded
2. **Given** a degraded provider succeeds, **When** checking status, **Then** I see the failure count has reset
3. **Given** I request provider status, **When** viewing the health information, **Then** I see status for all configured providers
4. **Given** a provider is consistently failing, **When** submissions occur, **Then** that provider is deprioritized

---

### User Story 4 - Consistent Message Delivery (Priority: P1)

As the recipient of contact form submissions, I need to receive messages in a consistent format regardless of which provider delivered them so I can process inquiries uniformly.

**Why this priority**: Essential for operations - recipients should not be affected by provider switching.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing email content delivered by different providers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the primary provider delivers a message, **When** I receive it, **Then** all form fields (name, email, subject, message) are included
2. **Given** the backup provider delivers a message, **When** I receive it, **Then** the format matches primary provider delivery
3. **Given** any provider delivers a message, **When** I view it, **Then** the content is identical to what was submitted

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when both providers are unavailable?
  - System queues the message locally and displays an error with retry option to user

- What happens when failover succeeds but primary recovers mid-submission?
  - Current submission completes with backup; subsequent submissions use primary

- What happens when a provider has rate limiting?
  - System respects rate limits and fails over if limits are reached

- What happens when provider credentials are invalid?
  - System logs error (without exposing credentials) and fails over immediately

- What happens when network connectivity is lost entirely?
  - System queues message locally (integrates with offline support from feature 022)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Provider Management**

- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple email providers with configurable priority
- **FR-002**: System MUST designate one provider as primary and others as backup
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow independent configuration of each provider
- **FR-004**: System MUST abstract provider differences behind a common interface

**Failover Behavior**

- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically switch to backup provider when primary fails
- **FR-006**: System MUST make provider switching invisible to users
- **FR-007**: System MUST return to primary provider when it recovers
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configurable failover threshold

**Retry Logic**

- **FR-009**: System MUST retry failed submissions before failing over
- **FR-010**: System MUST use exponential backoff between retry attempts
- **FR-011**: System MUST respect maximum retry limits
- **FR-012**: System MUST reset failure counts after successful delivery

**Health Monitoring**

- **FR-013**: System MUST track success/failure rates for each provider
- **FR-014**: System MUST expose provider health status for debugging
- **FR-015**: System MUST log errors without exposing sensitive information
- **FR-016**: System MUST deprioritize consistently failing providers

**Message Consistency**

- **FR-017**: System MUST deliver identical message content regardless of provider
- **FR-018**: System MUST include all form fields in delivered messages
- **FR-019**: System MUST maintain consistent formatting across providers

**Rate Limiting**

- **FR-020**: System MUST respect rate limits for each provider
- **FR-021**: System MUST fail over if rate limits are reached

### Key Entities

- **Email Provider**: Configured delivery service; includes name, priority, status, failure count, last success time
- **Submission Attempt**: Individual delivery try; includes provider used, timestamp, success status, error message
- **Provider Health**: Aggregate status; includes availability percentage, recent failures, degradation status
- **Failover Event**: Provider switch occurrence; includes from provider, to provider, reason, timestamp

---

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 99.9% of submissions are delivered when at least one provider is available
- **SC-002**: Failover occurs within 5 seconds of primary provider failure
- **SC-003**: Users see success/error within 10 seconds regardless of failover
- **SC-004**: 0% of users are aware of provider switching during submission
- **SC-005**: Message content is 100% identical between providers
- **SC-006**: Provider health status is accurate within 1 minute of status change

## Constraints _(optional)_

- Custom SMTP server integration is not supported
- Email tracking and analytics are out of scope
- Bulk email sending is not supported
- Email scheduling is not supported
- Rich HTML email templates are not customizable

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires contact form feature (022) as the primary submission interface
- Integrates with offline queue (020) for local storage when all providers fail
- Must comply with rate limits of configured email services

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- At least one email provider will be available most of the time
- Provider outages are typically temporary (minutes, not hours)
- Network issues are more common than provider outages
- Users have JavaScript enabled for retry functionality
