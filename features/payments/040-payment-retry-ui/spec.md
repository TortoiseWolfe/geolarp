## Implementation Status

**Last audited**: 2026-04-28
**Real status**: Mostly Shipped (recovery UX shipped; saved-method storage out of scope for static-export architecture)
**Tracking**: see gap-audit GitHub issues + STATUS.md

### Shipped

- `payment-service.ts` retry logic with idempotency-key reuse (FR-006), retry cap (FR-009, RETRY_LIMIT=3), cooling period (FR-010, COOLING_PERIOD_MS=30s), expiry guard, and audit logging (NFR-007)
- `/payment-result?id=<intent-uuid>` route (commit `ffb33a1`, 2026-04-16) — 6-state page, `<ProtectedRoute>` gated
- `<PaymentStatusDisplay>` — categorized error message + resolution hint (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003), transaction reference for support (FR-004), attempt counter (FR-008), cooling-state countdown, recovery-list disclosure (FR-016/017/019)
- `<OfflineRetryBanner>` — silent in steady state; surfaces queue count when offline or syncing
- `<SwitchProviderPanel>` — inline payment-method switcher reusing `<PaymentButton>`'s multi-provider machinery (Stripe / PayPal / Cash App / Chime); satisfies FR-018 "alternative payment options"
- Schema: `payment_intents.retry_count`, `payment_intents.parent_intent_id`, `auth_audit_logs` event_type extended with `payment_retry`
- E2E coverage: offline-banner test (cross-browser via dispatched `offline` event), switch-provider panel mount, recovery-list escalation

### Out of scope (architecture-fit reframings)

- **US3 reframed as "switch payment method (provider switch)"**: the spec's literal "Update Payment Method" (FR-011-FR-015) assumes saved cards + stripe.js Elements + a PCI surface. ScriptHammer never stores cards — every checkout is a fresh Stripe-hosted Checkout (or PayPal redirect, or Cash App / Chime direct link). The honest interpretation in this codebase is "after a card decline, let the user pick a different provider." Implemented via `<SwitchProviderPanel>` in PR #43-followup. Saved-card storage (Stripe Customer + saved_payment_methods table + `<CardElement>`) is a separate multi-PR feature and not appropriate for this template's static-export architecture.
- **US4 reframed as inline progressive disclosure**: a separate wizard component + route is unnecessary when the failed-state block can escalate UI density based on `retry_count`. The recovery list (retry → switch method → contact support) becomes visible at retry_count=2 and emphasizes support at retry_count=3. Honors FR-016/017/018/019 without adding a stepper component.

### Notes

- Route name is `/payment-result` (kebab-case top-level, matches `/payment-demo` and 8 other flat routes); the original spec said `/payment/result`. Renamed at implementation time; doc-correction shipped in PR #62. Future sibling routes (`/payment-dashboard`, `/payment-history`, `/payment-subscriptions`) follow the same kebab-case convention unless a shared `/payment/` shell is justified.
- The retry button reuses the parent intent's `idempotency_key` so doubled clicks become server-side ON CONFLICT no-ops via the partial unique index (PR #59 + PR #63 dedupe contract).
- Error categorization: 8 categories in `src/lib/payments/error-categorization.ts`; non-recoverable categories (`expired_card`, `limit_exceeded`) hide retry and show support-contact link.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Payment Error Display (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can see clear, understandable error messages when my payment fails so I know what went wrong and what I can do about it.

**Why this priority**: Users must understand why payment failed before they can take corrective action.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering various payment failures and verifying appropriate error messages are displayed with actionable guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a payment failure, **When** the error is displayed, **Then** a clear reason for failure is shown
2. **Given** a specific error type (declined, insufficient funds, expired), **When** identified, **Then** a targeted message with relevant context is provided
3. **Given** an actionable error, **When** displayed, **Then** specific resolution steps are shown
4. **Given** an error requiring support, **When** appropriate, **Then** a support contact option is provided

---

### User Story 2 - Retry Payment (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can retry a failed payment with a single click so I can quickly resolve temporary payment issues.

**Why this priority**: Immediate retry is the simplest resolution path for transient errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking retry on a failed payment and verifying the reattempt processes correctly with appropriate feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a failed payment with retry available, **When** displayed, **Then** a retry button is visible
2. **Given** retry is clicked, **When** processing, **Then** a loading state is shown
3. **Given** retry is successful, **When** complete, **Then** a success confirmation is displayed
4. **Given** retry fails, **When** error persists, **Then** an updated error with new suggestions is displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Update Payment Method (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can update my payment method when my current method fails so I can complete my transaction with a valid payment source.

**Why this priority**: Card-related failures (declined, expired) require payment method changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering a card decline, updating payment method, and verifying automatic retry with new method.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a card-related decline, **When** displayed, **Then** an option to update payment method is shown
2. **Given** update is clicked, **When** form opens, **Then** current payment method info is displayed (masked)
3. **Given** new payment method entered, **When** saved, **Then** the new method is stored securely
4. **Given** method updated, **When** successful, **Then** payment is automatically reattempted with new method

---

### User Story 4 - Guided Recovery Flow (Priority: P2)

As a user, I can follow a guided recovery wizard when standard retry fails so I can systematically resolve payment issues.

**Why this priority**: Provides escalation path when simple retry doesn't work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering persistent failure and verifying the wizard guides user through prioritized resolution steps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple resolution options, **When** displayed, **Then** options are prioritized by likelihood of success
2. **Given** wizard flow, **When** followed, **Then** steps are clear and sequential
3. **Given** recovery is successful, **When** complete, **Then** user returns to normal checkout flow
4. **Given** recovery is exhausted, **When** all options fail, **Then** an escalation path to support is provided

### Edge Cases

- What if the payment method is valid but the specific transaction amount is declined?
  - Show amount-specific message; suggest splitting payment or using different method

- What if the user's session expires during the recovery flow?
  - Preserve recovery state; restore after re-authentication

- What if multiple retry attempts are made rapidly?
  - Enforce cooling period between retries; show countdown timer

- What if the payment provider is temporarily unavailable?
  - Show provider status; offer to save payment for later retry

- What if the user cancels during payment method update?
  - Return to error screen with original options; no data loss

- **FR-019**: System MUST provide support contact option when automated recovery fails

### Non-Functional Requirements

**User Experience**
