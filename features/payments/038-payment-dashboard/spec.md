## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Payment History View (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can view my complete payment history with filtering and search capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - users need visibility into past transactions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading dashboard and verifying payment list displays correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dashboard is loaded, **When** viewing payment history, **Then** all user's payments are displayed
2. **Given** a filter is applied, **When** searching, **Then** results are filtered correctly
3. **Given** a date range is selected, **When** applied, **Then** only matching payments are shown
4. **Given** a payment row is clicked, **When** expanded, **Then** full payment details are displayed

### User Story 2 - Recent Transactions (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can see my most recent transactions with real-time updates.

**Why this priority**: Real-time updates reduce support burden and improve user confidence.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing a payment and verifying it appears immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new payment is processed, **When** complete, **Then** it appears in the dashboard immediately
2. **Given** a transaction status changes, **When** updated, **Then** the dashboard reflects the change
3. **Given** a failed payment is retried, **When** status updates, **Then** the change is visible in real-time
4. **Given** a refund is issued, **When** processed, **Then** it appears in recent transactions

### User Story 3 - Subscription Overview (Priority: P2)

As a user, I can view my active subscriptions and billing information.

**Why this priority**: Subscription visibility reduces billing inquiries and enables self-service.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing subscription section and verifying plan details are accurate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active subscription, **When** viewing the dashboard, **Then** next billing date is displayed
2. **Given** subscription details, **When** displayed, **Then** plan information is accurate
3. **Given** multiple subscriptions, **When** listed, **Then** all are shown with current status
4. **Given** subscription management options, **When** available, **Then** upgrade/downgrade options are accessible

### User Story 4 - Payment Analytics (Priority: P3)

As a user, I can access basic analytics about my payment patterns.

**Why this priority**: Spending insights add value but are not core to dashboard functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing analytics section and verifying data accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** payment data exists, **When** analyzed, **Then** spending summary is displayed
2. **Given** a time period is selected, **When** changed, **Then** charts update accordingly
3. **Given** export is requested, **When** clicked, **Then** payment data is downloadable

### Edge Cases

- What if user has no payment history?
  - Display empty state with helpful message explaining the dashboard

- What if real-time connection is lost?
  - Show offline indicator; queue updates for when connection resumes

- What if a payment is processing for extended time?
  - Show "processing" status with estimated completion time

- What if pagination loads duplicate entries?
  - Ensure unique transaction IDs; deduplicate on display

- What if date filter range is invalid (end before start)?
  - Validate dates; show error and prevent filter application

- What if exported file is very large?
  - Paginate export or show progress indicator for large datasets
