# Feature: Payment Dashboard

**Feature ID**: 038
**Category**: payments
**Source**: ScriptHammer README (SPEC-054)
**Status**: Components Built, Route Missing (2026-04-08). Built: `PaymentHistory` (component with tests + stories + a11y), `PaymentTrendChart` (molecular), `AdminPaymentPanel` (organism, used at `/admin/payments`), `admin-payment-service.ts`. Missing: no `page.tsx` at `/payment/dashboard` — needs a route file that composes the existing components. Also missing: real-time subscription wiring for the dashboard's live-update behavior (webhook status pill, tx counter, batch updates, connection loss/reconnect indicators, charts tied to live data). 20 E2E stubs in `tests/e2e/payment/06-realtime-dashboard.spec.ts` define the target UX. Depends on 024 API keys being activated.

## Description

4. Given payment clicked, when expanded, then full details displayed

### US-2: Recent Transactions (P1)

Users see their most recent transactions with real-time updates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given new payment, when processed, then appears immediately

2. Given time period, when selected, then charts update accordingly
3. Given export requested, when clicked, then payment data downloadable

## Requirements

### Functional

**Dashboard Layout**

- FR-001: Implement payment history table with pagination

### Non-Functional

**Performance**

- NFR-003: Pagination for large datasets

**Accessibility**

- NFR-004: Screen reader support for tables
- NFR-005: Keyboard navigation for all actions
- NFR-006: ARIA live regions for updates

### Components (5-File Pattern)

All components MUST follow the 5-file pattern per constitution:

```
src/components/payments/
├── PaymentDashboard/
│   ├── index.tsx                          # Re-exports
│   ├── PaymentDashboard.tsx               # Main component
│   ├── PaymentDashboard.test.tsx          # Unit tests (Vitest)
│   ├── PaymentDashboard.stories.tsx       # Storybook stories
│   ├── PaymentDashboard.accessibility.test.tsx  # Pa11y a11y tests
│   ├── PaymentHistory.tsx                 # Sub-component
│   ├── RecentTransactions.tsx             # Sub-component
│   ├── SubscriptionOverview.tsx           # Sub-component
│   └── PaymentFilters.tsx                 # Sub-component
```

**Note**: Sub-components (PaymentHistory, etc.) that are only used internally don't need their own 5-file structure. Only export the main PaymentDashboard component.

### Database

```sql
-- Real-time subscription
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_payment_change()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM pg_notify('payment_changes', json_build_object(
    'user_id', NEW.user_id,
    'payment_id', NEW.id,
    'status', NEW.status
  )::text);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Out of Scope

- Admin payment management
- Bulk payment operations
- Payment dispute handling UI
- Multi-currency conversion

## Success Criteria

- SC-001: Payment history displays all user payments
- SC-002: Real-time updates work reliably
- SC-003: Filters accurately narrow results
- SC-004: Dashboard accessible via keyboard
- SC-005: Performance meets NFR targets
