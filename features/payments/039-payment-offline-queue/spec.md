## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Queue Status Indicator (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can see a clear indication of pending offline payments so I know payments are waiting to process.

**Why this priority**: Core visibility - users must know when payments are queued.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by queuing a payment offline and verifying the indicator appears with correct count.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an offline payment is queued, **When** viewing the UI, **Then** an indicator shows the pending count
2. **Given** multiple pending payments exist, **When** displayed, **Then** total count is accurate
3. **Given** the queue is processing, **When** syncing begins, **Then** a progress indicator is shown
4. **Given** all payments are processed, **When** complete, **Then** the indicator clears

---

### User Story 2 - Pending Payment List (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can view a list of payments waiting to be processed so I can track my offline transactions.

**Why this priority**: Users need visibility into queued payments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by queuing multiple payments and verifying all appear in the list with correct details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** queued payments exist, **When** viewing the list, **Then** all pending payments are shown
2. **Given** a payment item, **When** displayed, **Then** amount and description are visible
3. **Given** a queued timestamp, **When** shown, **Then** the time payment was queued is displayed
4. **Given** payment status changes, **When** updated, **Then** the display reflects the current processing state

---

### User Story 3 - Retry Mechanism (Priority: P2)

As a user, I can manually retry failed offline payments so I can resolve payment issues.

**Why this priority**: Enables user control over failed payment recovery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering a retry on a failed payment and verifying the reattempt process.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a failed payment, **When** retry is clicked, **Then** the payment is reattempted
2. **Given** retry is in progress, **When** processing, **Then** a loading state is shown
3. **Given** retry is successful, **When** complete, **Then** the payment moves to history
4. **Given** retry fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** a clear error message is displayed

---

### User Story 4 - Queue Management (Priority: P2)

As a user, I can manage my offline payment queue so I can cancel or modify pending payments.

**Why this priority**: User control over their payment queue.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by canceling a pending payment and verifying it is removed from the queue.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pending payment, **When** cancel is clicked, **Then** it is removed from the queue
2. **Given** cancellation is requested, **When** confirmed, **Then** the payment is deleted
3. **Given** clear all is requested, **When** confirmed, **Then** the entire queue is cleared
4. **Given** a destructive action, **When** initiated, **Then** a confirmation dialog is shown

### Edge Cases

- What if the device comes online during queue viewing?
  - Automatically begin processing; update UI in real-time

- What if a payment in the queue becomes invalid (e.g., expired card)?
  - Show error status with specific reason; allow user to cancel or update

- What if network is intermittent during retry?
  - Queue retry for next stable connection; show "waiting for connection" status

- What if user tries to cancel a payment that's already processing?
  - Disable cancel button during processing; show processing status

- What if the queue storage is corrupted or unavailable?
  - Show error state with recovery options; attempt to restore from backup if available

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Queue Status Display**

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a badge with the count of pending payments
- **FR-002**: System MUST show queue status in a visible navigation area
- **FR-003**: System MUST indicate when the queue is actively syncing
- **FR-004**: System MUST update the count in real-time as payments process

**Pending Payment List**

- **FR-005**: System MUST list all pending offline payments
- **FR-006**: System MUST display payment amount and description for each item
- **FR-007**: System MUST show the time each payment was queued
- **FR-008**: System MUST indicate the processing status of each payment
- **FR-009**: System MUST support sorting by queue order or time

**Retry Functionality**

- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a retry button for each failed payment
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a "retry all" button for bulk operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST show the retry attempt count for each payment
- **FR-013**: System MUST display the last retry timestamp
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle retry rate limiting gracefully

**Queue Management**

- **FR-015**: System MUST allow cancellation of individual pending payments
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement "clear all" with confirmation dialog
- **FR-017**: System MUST persist the queue across browser sessions

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Reliability**

- **NFR-001**: Queue MUST survive application restart
- **NFR-002**: Queue MUST persist through browser close
- **NFR-003**: System MUST automatically retry payments when connectivity is restored

**Performance**

- **NFR-004**: Queue operations MUST complete in less than 100ms
- **NFR-005**: System MUST support batch processing for multiple retries

**User Experience**

- **NFR-006**: System MUST provide clear visual distinction between queued and processed payments
- **NFR-007**: System MUST show confirmation dialogs for all destructive actions

**Accessibility**

- **NFR-008**: Queue status MUST be announced to screen readers when count changes
- **NFR-009**: All queue actions MUST be accessible via keyboard

### Key Entities

- **Queued Payment**: A payment waiting to be processed, with amount, description, queue time, retry count, and status

- **Queue Status**: The overall state of the offline queue (empty, pending, syncing, error)

- **Payment Status**: Individual payment state (pending, processing, failed, completed)

---

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Queue badge accurately reflects pending payment count
- **SC-002**: All queued payments are visible in the pending list
- **SC-003**: Retry mechanism successfully processes payments when online
- **SC-004**: Queue persists across browser sessions and app restarts
- **SC-005**: Users receive clear feedback for all queue operations

---

## Constraints _(optional)_

- UI component only (no background sync implementation)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Must work without network connectivity for viewing queue

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires Feature 024 (payment-integration) for payment processing
- Requires Feature 020 (pwa-background-sync) for sync infrastructure

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- Queue storage is available through browser storage mechanism
- Background sync triggers queue processing automatically when online
- User authentication is available for queue association
