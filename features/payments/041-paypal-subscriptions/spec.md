## Overview

Subscription management dashboard for users who pay via PayPal. Users can view all active subscriptions, see billing cycle details, cancel subscriptions, and temporarily pause/resume subscriptions. All PayPal API interactions happen through secure server-side functions to protect API credentials. Subscription data is cached locally for performance with automatic synchronization.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Active Subscriptions List (Priority: P1)

A user views all their active PayPal subscriptions in a consolidated dashboard to understand what they're paying for.

**Why this priority**: Users need visibility into their subscriptions to manage spending. Core functionality for the feature.

**Independent Test**: Load subscriptions page with authenticated user, verify all active subscriptions display with plan names and prices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has active PayPal subscriptions, **When** viewing subscriptions page, **Then** all subscriptions listed with plan name, price, and status
2. **Given** subscription details, **When** displayed, **Then** plan name, billing amount, and frequency shown clearly
3. **Given** subscription status (active, paused, cancelled), **When** shown, **Then** current status displayed with visual indicator
4. **Given** user has no subscriptions, **When** viewing subscriptions page, **Then** empty state with helpful message displayed
5. **Given** subscription ID, **When** viewing details, **Then** reference ID shown for support inquiries
6. **Given** subscriptions loading, **When** fetching from provider, **Then** loading state shown

---

### User Story 2 - Cancel Subscription (Priority: P1)

A user cancels a PayPal subscription they no longer want, with clear understanding of implications.

**Why this priority**: Cancellation is a critical user right. Must be easy and transparent to maintain trust.

**Independent Test**: Click cancel on subscription, confirm in dialog, verify subscription status changes to cancelled with end date.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** active subscription, **When** cancel button clicked, **Then** confirmation dialog appears
2. **Given** confirmation dialog, **When** displayed, **Then** cancellation implications explained (end date, refund policy)
3. **Given** cancellation confirmed, **When** processed, **Then** subscription status changes to cancelled
4. **Given** cancellation complete, **When** viewing subscription, **Then** service end date displayed
5. **Given** cancellation failed, **When** error occurs, **Then** error message shown with retry option
6. **Given** cancelled subscription, **When** viewing, **Then** resubscribe option available (link to signup)

---

### User Story 3 - Pause Subscription (Priority: P2)

A user temporarily pauses a subscription instead of cancelling, preserving their ability to resume later.

**Why this priority**: Pause reduces churn by offering alternative to cancellation. Important but not all subscriptions support it.

**Independent Test**: Click pause on pausable subscription, select duration, confirm, verify subscription shows paused status with resume date.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** subscription that supports pausing, **When** pause button clicked, **Then** duration options shown
2. **Given** subscription that doesn't support pausing, **When** viewing, **Then** pause option disabled with explanation
3. **Given** duration selected (1 month, 3 months), **When** confirmed, **Then** subscription paused until that date
4. **Given** paused subscription, **When** viewing, **Then** resume date and resume button displayed
5. **Given** resume button clicked, **When** processed, **Then** subscription reactivated immediately
6. **Given** pause/resume operation, **When** processing, **Then** loading state shown on action button

---

### User Story 4 - Billing Cycle Display (Priority: P1)

A user views clear billing cycle information to understand when and how much they'll be charged.

**Why this priority**: Billing transparency prevents surprise charges and support inquiries. Essential for user trust.

**Independent Test**: View subscription details, verify billing frequency, next charge date, and amount breakdown displayed accurately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** subscription, **When** viewing details, **Then** billing frequency shown (monthly, yearly)
2. **Given** active subscription, **When** displayed, **Then** next billing date shown accurately
3. **Given** billing amount, **When** displayed, **Then** total includes base price, taxes, and fees with breakdown
4. **Given** billing history needed, **When** link clicked, **Then** navigates to payment history or PayPal
5. **Given** payment method info, **When** displayed, **Then** shows PayPal email (masked for privacy)

### Edge Cases

**Subscription State Edge Cases**:

- Subscription in grace period (past due but not yet cancelled)
- Subscription pending activation (just created)
- Multiple subscriptions to same plan (edge case, should show both)
- Subscription with trial period active

**API/Sync Edge Cases**:

- PayPal API unavailable (show cached data with warning)
- Subscription exists in PayPal but not in local cache
- Local cache outdated (status changed in PayPal directly)
- Rate limit hit during sync (handle gracefully, retry later)

**Cancellation Edge Cases**:

- Cancel attempted during billing cycle transition
- User cancels then wants to undo (redirect to resubscribe)
- Partial refund eligibility on cancel
- Subscription already cancelled in PayPal

**Pause Edge Cases**:

- Pause during trial period
- Extend pause duration while already paused
- Resume attempted on cancelled subscription (not allowed)
- Pause limit reached (some plans limit pause frequency)

**Billing Edge Cases**:

- Currency conversion for international users
- Price change pending on next renewal
- Failed payment pending retry
- Tax rate change affecting total

## Dependencies

- **024-Payment Integration**: Base payment infrastructure
- **042-Payment RLS Policies**: Row-level security for payment data
- **003-User Authentication**: Authenticated user context

## Out of Scope

- PayPal subscription creation (handled by checkout flow in 024)
- Plan upgrade/downgrade through PayPal
- PayPal dispute and chargeback management
- PayPal payment method management (add/change card)
- Subscription analytics and reporting
- Admin subscription management interface
- Webhook handling for real-time sync (future enhancement)

## Assumptions

- Payment integration (024) provides base infrastructure for PayPal connectivity
- Server-side function environment is available for secure API calls
- PayPal Subscriptions API is enabled for the merchant account
- Not all PayPal subscription plans support pausing (plan-dependent)
- Users have already subscribed through the checkout flow
- Billing history can link to PayPal portal (not replicated locally)
