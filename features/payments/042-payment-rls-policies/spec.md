<!-- AUDIT-IMPL-STATUS-BEGIN -->

## Implementation Status

**Last audited**: 2026-04-25
**Real status**: Backend Only
**Tracking**: see gap-audit GitHub issues + STATUS.md

### Shipped

- 20+ RLS policies in monolithic migration

### Gaps

- RLS policies unverified (25 test stubs await un-skip + run)
- Rate-limit UI missing

### Notes

- Verification work, not new code. Flip skip flags, run, fix any policy mismatches.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Payment Data Access Control (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can only view my own payment records, ensuring my financial data is private.

**Why this priority**: Core security requirement - financial data privacy is paramount.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by querying payments as different users and verifying isolation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** querying payments, **Then** only their own payments are returned
2. **Given** an unauthenticated request, **When** payment data is requested, **Then** access is denied
3. **Given** a user attempting to access another user's payment ID, **When** queried, **Then** no results are returned
4. **Given** a service operation (e.g., webhook processing), **When** accessing payment data, **Then** appropriate elevated access is granted

---

### User Story 2 - Subscription Access Control (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can only view and manage my own subscriptions.

**Why this priority**: Subscription data is sensitive and must be protected like payments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying users cannot access other users' subscription data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** querying subscriptions, **Then** only their own subscriptions are shown
2. **Given** a user attempting to modify another's subscription, **When** action is attempted, **Then** operation is denied
3. **Given** a cancelled subscription, **When** queried by the owner, **Then** it is still visible for history
4. **Given** a service operation requiring cross-user access, **When** needed, **Then** elevated access is available

---

### User Story 3 - Payment Creation Security (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I need to ensure payment records can only be created through authorized flows.

**Why this priority**: Prevents fraudulent payment records and ensures data integrity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to insert payment records with various user contexts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a payment insert from a client application, **When** processed, **Then** it can only be for the authenticated user
2. **Given** a payment insert from a service operation, **When** processed, **Then** any user's payment can be created
3. **Given** an attempt to create a payment for a different user, **When** from a regular user context, **Then** insert is denied
4. **Given** a webhook processing a payment, **When** updating records, **Then** service-level access is used

---

### User Story 4 - Audit Trail Protection (Priority: P2)

As a compliance officer, I need payment audit logs to be protected from tampering.

**Why this priority**: Audit trails must be immutable for compliance and fraud detection.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to modify audit log entries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an audit log insert attempt by a regular user, **When** attempted, **Then** operation is denied
2. **Given** an audit log read by a user, **When** queried, **Then** only their own records are visible
3. **Given** an audit log update attempt, **When** attempted by any user, **Then** operation is denied
4. **Given** an audit log delete attempt, **When** attempted by any user, **Then** operation is denied

### Edge Cases

- What if a user's account is deleted but payments exist?
  - Payments are retained for compliance; marked as orphaned for admin review

- What if service operations fail mid-transaction?
  - Transaction rollback ensures no partial data; retry logic in service layer

- What if a user disputes a payment they claim not to have made?
  - Audit logs provide complete history; immutable records support investigation

- What if concurrent payment operations occur?
  - Database-level locking ensures consistency; no race conditions

- What if payment method is shared between users (family plan)?
  - Not supported in this version; each payment method belongs to one user

- What if admin needs to view all payments for support?
  - Admin access handled in separate admin panel feature

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Payment Data Protection**

- **FR-001**: System MUST enable row-level security on payment data
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to view only their own payment records
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to create payment records only for themselves
- **FR-004**: System MUST restrict payment updates to service operations only
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent direct deletion of payment records (soft delete pattern)

**Subscription Data Protection**

- **FR-006**: System MUST enable row-level security on subscription data
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to view only their own subscriptions
- **FR-008**: System MUST restrict subscription creation to service operations only
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow limited updates by owner (e.g., cancellation) and full updates by service operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent direct deletion of subscription records

**Payment Method Protection**

- **FR-011**: System MUST enable row-level security on saved payment methods
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to view only their own payment methods
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to add their own payment methods
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to update their own payment methods
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to remove their own saved payment methods

**Audit Log Protection**

- **FR-016**: System MUST enable row-level security on payment audit logs
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow users to view only their own audit log entries
- **FR-018**: System MUST restrict audit log creation to service operations only
- **FR-019**: System MUST deny all audit log updates
- **FR-020**: System MUST deny all audit log deletions

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Security**

- **NFR-001**: All payment-related data MUST have row-level security enabled
- **NFR-002**: No security policy shall allow cross-user data access
- **NFR-003**: Service-level access MUST be documented and used only when necessary

**Performance**

- **NFR-004**: Security policies MUST use indexed columns for efficient evaluation
- **NFR-005**: Security policy evaluation MUST add less than 10ms overhead per query

**Compliance**

- **NFR-006**: Security policies MUST support data access requests (GDPR/CCPA)
- **NFR-007**: Audit trails MUST be immutable once created

### Key Entities

- **Payment Record**: A single payment transaction with user association

- **Subscription**: An ongoing billing relationship with user association

- **Payment Method**: A saved payment instrument (card, bank) owned by a user

- **Audit Log Entry**: An immutable record of payment-related actions

---

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All payment-related data has row-level security enabled
- **SC-002**: Users can only access their own data (verified by cross-user access tests)
- **SC-003**: Service operations can access data when required for webhooks and processing
- **SC-004**: Audit logs are immutable (no update or delete operations succeed)
- **SC-005**: Security policy evaluation adds less than 10ms overhead per query
- **SC-006**: All security policy tests pass in integration test suite

---

## Constraints _(optional)_

- Soft delete pattern required for all payment data (no permanent deletion)
- Service-level access must be audited
- Policies must not break existing payment flows

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires Feature 000 (rls-implementation) for base security patterns
- Requires Feature 024 (payment-integration) for payment tables to exist

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- Authentication system provides verified user identity
- Service operations use elevated access context
- Payment tables already exist with user association columns
- Audit logging infrastructure exists
