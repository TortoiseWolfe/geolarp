## Overview

Accessibility test coverage for game components to ensure all game features are usable by people with disabilities. Tests cover keyboard navigation, ARIA attribute verification, focus management, and visual accessibility. Seven game components require testing: DiceRoller, CardDeck, CharacterSheet, InitiativeTracker, MapGrid, ChatPanel, and RollLog. Tests use automated accessibility checking tools combined with interaction testing.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Keyboard Navigation Tests (Priority: P1)

A test developer writes accessibility tests to verify all game interactions work with keyboard only, ensuring users who cannot use a mouse can fully participate.

**Why this priority**: Keyboard access is fundamental accessibility. Without it, motor-impaired users are completely excluded.

**Independent Test**: Focus on DiceRoller, press Enter, verify roll triggers and result is announced.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** game controls rendered, **When** pressing Tab repeatedly, **Then** all interactive elements receive focus in logical order
2. **Given** interactive element focused (button, link), **When** pressing Enter or Space, **Then** action triggers
3. **Given** modal or overlay open, **When** pressing Escape, **Then** modal closes and focus returns
4. **Given** grid or list component (MapGrid, InitiativeTracker), **When** pressing Arrow keys, **Then** selection moves appropriately
5. **Given** component with shortcut keys defined, **When** shortcut pressed, **Then** action triggers
6. **Given** form inputs (CharacterSheet), **When** navigating with Tab, **Then** all fields reachable in order

---

### User Story 2 - ARIA Verification Tests (Priority: P1)

A test developer writes accessibility tests to verify proper ARIA attributes enable screen reader users to understand and interact with game components.

**Why this priority**: ARIA attributes are essential for screen reader users. Without them, game state is invisible to blind users.

**Independent Test**: Render DiceRoller, verify aria-label on roll button and aria-live on result display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** game component rendered, **When** checked with accessibility tool, **Then** all required role attributes present
2. **Given** interactive element focused, **When** screen reader reads, **Then** accessible name announced (aria-label or aria-labelledby)
3. **Given** element with description, **When** focused, **Then** aria-describedby provides additional context
4. **Given** live region (RollLog, ChatPanel), **When** content updates, **Then** aria-live announces changes
5. **Given** expandable element, **When** toggled, **Then** aria-expanded state updates correctly
6. **Given** hidden element, **When** not visible, **Then** aria-hidden is true

---

### User Story 3 - Focus Management Tests (Priority: P2)

A test developer writes accessibility tests to verify focus is properly managed during game interactions, ensuring users never lose their place.

**Why this priority**: Proper focus management prevents confusion for keyboard and screen reader users navigating complex game states.

**Independent Test**: Open character sheet modal, verify focus moves to modal and is trapped until closed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** game component mounts, **When** initial focus set, **Then** appropriate element receives focus
2. **Given** modal opened (e.g., CharacterSheet popup), **When** focus trap active, **Then** Tab cycles within modal only
3. **Given** modal closed, **When** returning to game, **Then** focus returns to element that opened modal
4. **Given** any focused element, **When** visible, **Then** focus indicator meets visibility requirements
5. **Given** dynamic content added (new chat message), **When** focus managed, **Then** user position not disrupted
6. **Given** component destroyed, **When** unmounted, **Then** focus moves to appropriate fallback

---

### User Story 4 - Visual Accessibility Tests (Priority: P3)

A test developer writes accessibility tests to verify game elements meet visual accessibility requirements for users with low vision or color blindness.

**Why this priority**: Visual accessibility expands usability but automated testing has limitations. Manual testing supplements this.

**Independent Test**: Check DiceRoller result text against background for WCAG AA contrast ratio.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** game text elements, **When** contrast checked, **Then** ratio meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text)
2. **Given** colorblind mode enabled, **When** game viewed, **Then** all elements distinguishable without color alone
3. **Given** focus indicator on element, **When** visible, **Then** indicator meets 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors
4. **Given** user prefers reduced motion, **When** preference detected, **Then** animations disabled or reduced
5. **Given** high contrast mode, **When** enabled, **Then** all elements remain visible and functional

### Edge Cases

**Keyboard Navigation Edge Cases**:

- Disabled buttons should be skipped in tab order or clearly announced as disabled
- Custom keyboard shortcuts should not conflict with browser or screen reader shortcuts
- Roving tabindex in component groups (only one element tabbable at a time)
- Focus visible in both light and dark themes

**ARIA Edge Cases**:

- Dynamic content changes (adding/removing elements) preserve accessibility tree
- Complex widgets (grid, tree) have complete ARIA specification
- Nested live regions don't cause announcement spam
- Form validation errors associated with inputs via aria-describedby

**Focus Management Edge Cases**:

- Rapid modal open/close sequences
- Multiple overlapping modals (focus returns to correct trigger)
- Component unmount during animation
- Focus on removed element (fallback to next logical element)

**Visual Accessibility Edge Cases**:

- Theme switching maintains contrast
- User zoom levels (100% to 200%) don't break layout
- Text overlapping images or patterns
- Animated content respects prefers-reduced-motion

**Component-Specific Edge Cases**:

- DiceRoller: Result announcement timing (not too fast, not interrupting)
- CardDeck: Multiple cards selected, deck empty states
- MapGrid: Large grid navigation (100+ cells), token on cell announcements
- InitiativeTracker: Turn change announcements, current player indication
- ChatPanel: Message scrolling, new message while reading old ones
- RollLog: Rapid successive rolls, history navigation
