## Overview

Comprehensive unit test coverage for four core messaging services: message service, key service, group key service, and audit logger. These services handle encrypted messaging, cryptographic key management, and security auditing. Tests must validate encryption correctness, key lifecycle management, and audit logging while following security best practices (deterministic test vectors, no sensitive data exposure, proper cleanup).

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Message Service Tests (Priority: P1)

A test developer writes unit tests to verify message encryption, decryption, sending, and retrieval functions work correctly.

**Why this priority**: Core messaging functionality. Incorrect encryption/decryption breaks the entire messaging system.

**Independent Test**: Encrypt message with known key, decrypt with same key, verify content matches original.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** plaintext message and encryption key, **When** message encrypted, **Then** ciphertext is produced and differs from plaintext
2. **Given** encrypted message and decryption key, **When** message decrypted, **Then** original plaintext is recovered
3. **Given** message to send, **When** send operation completes, **Then** message is stored in database (mocked)
4. **Given** conversation ID, **When** messages retrieved, **Then** all messages for conversation returned in order

---

### User Story 2 - Key Service Tests (Priority: P1)

A test developer writes unit tests to verify encryption key generation, storage, and validation functions work correctly.

**Why this priority**: Key management is security-critical. Flawed key handling compromises all encrypted data.

**Independent Test**: Generate key pair, export public key, verify private key can decrypt data encrypted with public key.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new user needs keys, **When** key pair generated, **Then** public and private keys are created and cryptographically valid
2. **Given** generated public key, **When** exported, **Then** format is correct for sharing with other users
3. **Given** private key, **When** stored, **Then** key is retrievable and usable for decryption
4. **Given** key material, **When** validated, **Then** invalid/corrupted keys are rejected

---

### User Story 3 - Group Key Service Tests (Priority: P2)

A test developer writes unit tests to verify group encryption key distribution and rotation.

**Why this priority**: Group messaging requires multi-party key management. Important but less critical than basic messaging.

**Independent Test**: Create group, add member, verify new member can decrypt group messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new group created, **When** group key generated, **Then** all initial members receive key material
2. **Given** existing group, **When** member added, **Then** new member receives group key and can decrypt messages
3. **Given** member removed from group, **When** key rotated, **Then** removed member cannot decrypt new messages
4. **Given** key rotation occurred, **When** accessing old messages, **Then** old messages remain readable with archived keys

---

### User Story 4 - Audit Logger Tests (Priority: P2)

A test developer writes unit tests to verify security audit logging captures events correctly without exposing sensitive data.

**Why this priority**: Audit logs are essential for security monitoring but not user-facing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Log security event, query audit log, verify event is recorded with timestamp.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** security event occurs, **When** logged, **Then** timestamp, event type, and actor are recorded
2. **Given** audit log entries exist, **When** filtered by criteria, **Then** matching events are returned
3. **Given** event contains PII (email, name), **When** logged, **Then** PII is redacted or hashed
4. **Given** high-frequency events, **When** queried, **Then** timestamp ordering is accurate

### Edge Cases

**Encryption Edge Cases**:

- Empty message content
- Very long messages (>1MB)
- Unicode/emoji content
- Binary data in messages

**Key Management Edge Cases**:

- Key generation failure (insufficient entropy)
- Corrupted key material
- Expired keys if TTL implemented
- Key not found for user

**Group Key Edge Cases**:

- Single-member group
- Group with 100+ members
- Simultaneous member add/remove
- Key rotation during active conversations

**Audit Logger Edge Cases**:

- Rapid successive events (burst logging)
- Very long event descriptions
- Special characters in logged data
- Log storage full/unavailable

**Error Handling**:

- Database unavailable during operation
- Crypto library errors
- Invalid input parameters
- Timeout during key operations
