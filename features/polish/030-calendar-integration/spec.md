## Overview

A calendar scheduling integration that embeds third-party scheduling services (Calendly or Cal.com) into the application for appointment booking. The system supports both providers through a clean abstraction layer, ensuring that switching providers requires only configuration changes. The integration includes responsive embed design, theme-aware styling that adapts to all 32 application themes, and a GDPR-compliant consent flow that only loads third-party scripts after explicit user permission.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Book Appointment (Priority: P1)

A visitor wants to book an appointment or consultation through an embedded calendar scheduler without leaving the application.

**Why this priority**: Core feature value - appointment booking is the primary reason for the calendar integration. Without this, the feature serves no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to schedule page, select available time slot, complete booking, verify confirmation displays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** visitor navigates to /schedule page, **When** page loads completely, **Then** calendar embed displays with available time slots
2. **Given** calendar is displayed, **When** visitor selects a time slot, **Then** booking form appears for details entry
3. **Given** booking details entered, **When** visitor confirms appointment, **Then** booking is created with the provider
4. **Given** booking is complete, **When** confirmation displays, **Then** visitor sees appointment details and receives confirmation email

---

### User Story 2 - Consent-Gated Calendar Loading (Priority: P1)

A visitor must grant functional cookie consent before the third-party calendar service loads, ensuring GDPR compliance.

**Why this priority**: Legal requirement for GDPR compliance. Third-party scripts cannot load without explicit consent.

**Independent Test**: Load schedule page without consent, verify consent prompt displays instead of calendar, grant consent, verify calendar loads.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** visitor has not granted functional consent, **When** schedule page loads, **Then** consent prompt displays instead of calendar embed
2. **Given** consent prompt is displayed, **When** visitor grants functional consent, **Then** calendar embed loads immediately
3. **Given** visitor previously granted consent, **When** schedule page loads, **Then** calendar embed loads automatically
4. **Given** visitor revokes consent in settings, **When** schedule page revisited, **Then** consent prompt displays again

---

### User Story 3 - Theme-Aware Calendar Styling (Priority: P2)

A visitor sees a calendar embed that matches the current application theme for visual consistency.

**Why this priority**: Important for user experience and brand consistency, but not required for core booking functionality.

**Independent Test**: Switch between dark and light themes, verify calendar styling adapts appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** dark theme is active, **When** calendar embed loads, **Then** dark color scheme is applied to calendar
2. **Given** light theme is active, **When** calendar embed loads, **Then** light color scheme is applied to calendar
3. **Given** theme is switched while calendar is visible, **When** new theme activates, **Then** calendar styling updates without page refresh
4. **Given** any of the 32 available themes, **When** calendar displays, **Then** colors are harmonious with surrounding UI

---

### User Story 4 - Provider Abstraction (Priority: P2)

The site administrator can switch between Calendly and Cal.com providers through configuration without code changes.

**Why this priority**: Provides flexibility for future provider changes and cost optimization. Important for maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Deploy with CALENDAR_PROVIDER=calendly, verify Calendly loads; redeploy with calcom, verify Cal.com loads.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** configuration set to Calendly, **When** schedule page loads, **Then** Calendly embed is rendered
2. **Given** configuration set to Cal.com, **When** schedule page loads, **Then** Cal.com embed is rendered
3. **Given** provider is switched in configuration, **When** application is redeployed, **Then** correct provider loads with no code changes
4. **Given** invalid provider configured, **When** page loads, **Then** user-friendly error message displays

---

### User Story 5 - Calendar Analytics Tracking (Priority: P3)

The site owner receives analytics data about calendar interactions for marketing attribution.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have for marketing insights. Core booking functionality works without analytics.

**Independent Test**: Open calendar, select time, complete booking; verify each interaction triggers corresponding analytics event.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** calendar embed loads, **When** fully visible, **Then** "calendar_viewed" event is tracked
2. **Given** visitor selects a time slot, **When** selection made, **Then** "calendar_time_selected" event is tracked
3. **Given** booking is completed, **When** confirmation displays, **Then** "calendar_scheduled" event is tracked
4. **Given** analytics consent not granted, **When** events would fire, **Then** no tracking occurs

---

### Edge Cases

**No Consent Given**:

- Visitor never grants functional consent
- Calendar never loads, consent prompt persists
- Clear messaging explains why calendar can't display

**Provider Service Unavailable**:

- Calendly or Cal.com service is temporarily down
- System shows friendly error message with retry option
- Page remains functional without calendar embed

**Invalid Configuration**:

- Calendar URL is misconfigured or invalid
- System shows configuration error to admins only
- Visitors see generic "scheduling unavailable" message

**Unsupported Browser**:

- Browser doesn't support required features for embed
- Fallback message displays with direct link to booking page
- Core functionality accessible via external link

**Popup Blocker Active**:

- If popup mode enabled and blocked by browser
- System detects blocked popup and shows message
- Alternative inline mode or direct link offered

**Theme Not Mappable**:

- Custom theme colors don't map cleanly to provider palette
- System uses closest available theme colors
- Contrast requirements still met

**Mobile Viewport**:

- Very small screen sizes
- Embed adapts to available width
- Touch interactions work correctly
