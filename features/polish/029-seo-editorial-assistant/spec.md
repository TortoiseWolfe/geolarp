## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Edit Existing Blog Post with SEO Analysis (Priority: P1)

A content creator wants to edit an existing blog post while receiving real-time SEO feedback to improve content quality.

**Why this priority**: Core feature value - SEO analysis during editing is the primary use case. Without this, the feature has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Open existing post in editor, modify content, verify SEO panel updates in real-time with overall score.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** blog post exists in the system, **When** user clicks "Edit Post", **Then** editor opens with full content loaded including frontmatter
2. **Given** editor is open with content, **When** user types or modifies text, **Then** SEO analysis panel updates within 500ms (debounced)
3. **Given** changes have been made, **When** user clicks "Save", **Then** markdown file is updated with all frontmatter preserved
4. **Given** post has focus keyword defined, **When** viewing SEO panel, **Then** keyword optimization metrics are displayed

### User Story 2 - SEO Score and Suggestions (Priority: P1)

A content creator wants to see their SEO score and receive actionable suggestions to improve content ranking potential.

**Why this priority**: Essential companion to editing - the score and suggestions guide content improvements.

**Independent Test**: Edit a post with poor SEO metrics, verify score displays 0-100 with specific improvement suggestions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** post is being edited, **When** SEO panel is visible, **Then** overall score (0-100) is prominently displayed
2. **Given** score is below 70, **When** viewing suggestions section, **Then** prioritized list of actionable improvements is shown
3. **Given** user makes recommended changes, **When** content updates, **Then** traffic light indicator transitions (red→yellow→green)
4. **Given** all metrics pass, **When** viewing SEO panel, **Then** green indicator and "Optimized" status are displayed

### User Story 3 - Export Posts as ZIP Bundle (Priority: P2)

A content creator wants to export selected posts with their SEO reports for developer review before deployment.

**Why this priority**: Enables email-based workflow for teams without direct git access. Important for non-technical content teams.

**Independent Test**: Select multiple posts, click export, verify ZIP downloads with correct structure and contents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** one or more posts are selected, **When** "Export Selected" is clicked, **Then** ZIP file downloads automatically
2. **Given** ZIP is downloaded and opened, **When** viewing contents, **Then** contains posts/, seo-reports/, manifest.json, and summary.md
3. **Given** manifest.json is viewed, **When** parsing contents, **Then** shows export date, post list, changes made, and SEO scores per post
4. **Given** summary.md is viewed, **When** reading contents, **Then** human-readable overview of all exported posts is shown

---

### User Story 4 - Import ZIP Bundle (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to import an exported ZIP bundle to update blog posts in the repository.

**Why this priority**: Completes the round-trip workflow enabling content creator → developer handoff.

**Independent Test**: Run import script with valid ZIP, verify markdown files are placed correctly in /blog directory.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid ZIP bundle, **When** import script is executed, **Then** markdown files are copied to /blog directory
2. **Given** import would overwrite existing files, **When** importing, **Then** diff is shown for review before proceeding
3. **Given** successful import, **When** reviewing git status, **Then** changes are staged and ready for commit
4. **Given** invalid ZIP structure, **When** import attempted, **Then** clear error message explains the issue

---

### User Story 5 - Terminal-Friendly SEO Output (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to copy SEO analysis results in a terminal-friendly format for CI/CD integration or automation workflows.

**Why this priority**: Enables advanced automation use cases. Nice-to-have for technical users.

**Independent Test**: Click "Show Terminal Output", verify structured text is displayed and copyable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** SEO analysis is complete, **When** "Show Terminal Output" is clicked, **Then** copyable structured text is displayed
2. **Given** terminal output is copied and pasted, **When** viewed in terminal, **Then** formatting is preserved and readable
3. **Given** automation script parses output, **When** extracting metrics, **Then** all scores and suggestions are accessible
