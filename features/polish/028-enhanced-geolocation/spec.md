## Overview

Platform-aware geolocation system that automatically detects device type and selects the optimal location strategy. Desktop users get address search with autocomplete and click-to-set map functionality. Mobile users get GPS-based positioning with real-time accuracy feedback. All users see clear accuracy indicators showing confidence level and can manually override or refine their location.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Desktop Address Search (Priority: P1)

A desktop user wants to set their location by searching for their address rather than sharing browser geolocation.

**Why this priority**: Primary interaction method for desktop users. Search is more intuitive and accurate than IP-based guessing.

**Independent Test**: Type partial address in search box, select from autocomplete, verify map centers on correct location with pin.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** desktop user loads the page, **When** viewing the map interface, **Then** search box is prominently visible above the map
2. **Given** user types 3+ characters, **When** autocomplete appears, **Then** relevant address suggestions are displayed within 500ms
3. **Given** user selects an address, **When** selection is confirmed, **Then** map centers on location with a visible marker/pin
4. **Given** address selected, **When** viewing location info, **Then** formatted address is displayed alongside coordinates

### User Story 2 - Mobile GPS Location (Priority: P1)

A mobile user wants accurate GPS-based location that updates in real-time as accuracy improves.

**Why this priority**: Primary interaction method for mobile users. GPS is expected and most accurate on mobile devices.

**Independent Test**: Load on mobile with location permission granted, verify GPS location acquired within 3 seconds with accuracy indicator.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** mobile user with location permission, **When** page loads, **Then** GPS location is acquired within 3 seconds
2. **Given** GPS active, **When** accuracy improves by 50m or more, **Then** position updates automatically
3. **Given** user is moving, **When** position changes significantly, **Then** map updates smoothly without jarring jumps
4. **Given** GPS in use, **When** viewing accuracy indicator, **Then** accuracy radius is displayed visually on map

---

### User Story 3 - Desktop Click-to-Set Location (Priority: P2)

A desktop user wants to set their location by clicking directly on the map when address search doesn't find the right location.

**Why this priority**: Important fallback when addresses aren't indexed or user knows map location but not exact address.

**Independent Test**: Click on map location, verify marker appears at click point and coordinates update.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** map is displayed, **When** user clicks on a point, **Then** marker is placed at click location
2. **Given** marker exists, **When** user drags marker, **Then** location updates to new position
3. **Given** location is set manually, **When** page is revisited, **Then** manual location is remembered

---

### User Story 4 - Mobile Accuracy Indicator (Priority: P2)

A mobile user wants visual feedback about their location accuracy so they understand how precise their displayed location is.

**Why this priority**: Manages user expectations about location precision, especially in areas with poor GPS signal.

**Independent Test**: View location on mobile, verify accuracy radius circle and source indicator are visible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** location is active, **When** viewing map, **Then** accuracy radius circle is displayed around position marker
2. **Given** low accuracy (>100m), **When** viewing indicator, **Then** color indicates low confidence (e.g., orange/red)
3. **Given** high accuracy (<10m), **When** viewing indicator, **Then** color indicates high confidence (e.g., green)
4. **Given** location active, **When** viewing accuracy badge, **Then** source is shown (GPS, WiFi, IP, Manual)

---

### User Story 5 - Desktop IP Fallback (Priority: P2)

A desktop user who hasn't searched or clicked sees an approximate location based on IP address with clear accuracy messaging.

**Why this priority**: Provides reasonable default experience without requiring user interaction, but must clearly communicate low accuracy.

**Independent Test**: Load page without any location interaction, verify city-level location shown with "City level" accuracy indicator.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no user location interaction, **When** page loads, **Then** IP-based location estimate is shown on map
2. **Given** IP location displayed, **When** viewing accuracy indicator, **Then** "City level" or "Approximate" label is shown
3. **Given** low accuracy display, **When** viewing options, **Then** prompt to refine location is visible

---

### User Story 6 - Location Preferences Persistence (Priority: P3)

A user wants their location preferences and manual corrections to be remembered across browser sessions.

**Why this priority**: Convenience feature that reduces friction on repeat visits. Not critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Set manual location, close and reopen browser, verify location is restored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user manually corrected location, **When** page is revisited in new session, **Then** correction persists
2. **Given** user granted location consent, **When** page is revisited, **Then** consent status is remembered
3. **Given** user clicks "Clear location data", **When** confirmed, **Then** all stored location data is cleared

### Edge Cases

**Permission Denied**:

- User denies location permission on mobile
- System falls back to IP-based location with clear messaging
- Manual search/click options prominently displayed

**No Autocomplete Results**:

- Search query returns no address matches
- System shows "No results found" message
- Offers click-to-set as alternative

**GPS Unavailable**:

- Mobile device has GPS disabled or unavailable
- System falls back to WiFi/cell tower positioning
- Accuracy indicator reflects lower precision

**Rate Limiting**:

- Geocoding API rate limit exceeded (1 req/sec)
- System queues requests with user feedback
- Cached results used when available

**Very Low Accuracy**:

- Accuracy worse than 1km (IP fallback only)
- System clearly indicates low precision
- Strongly prompts for manual refinement

**Offline Mode**:

- No network connectivity for geocoding
- Cached tile display maintained
- Manual coordinate entry still works
