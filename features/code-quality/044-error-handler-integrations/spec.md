## Overview

Comprehensive error handling system integrating monitoring services with user-friendly error notifications. Captures unhandled errors, provides session replay for debugging, displays toast notifications to users, and implements error boundaries to prevent application crashes. All third-party monitoring services require user consent before initialization per privacy requirements.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Error Logging Integration (Priority: P1)

A developer investigates a production error using comprehensive error logs that include user context, session data, and navigation history.

**Why this priority**: Error visibility is essential for maintaining application quality. Developers cannot fix what they cannot see.

**Independent Test**: Trigger an unhandled error in the application, verify it appears in the monitoring dashboard with user context and breadcrumbs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** unhandled JavaScript error, **When** thrown, **Then** error captured and sent to monitoring service
2. **Given** unhandled promise rejection, **When** occurs, **Then** rejection captured with stack trace
3. **Given** error with user logged in, **When** captured, **Then** user ID and session ID included in report
4. **Given** navigation between pages, **When** error occurs, **Then** breadcrumbs show user's navigation path
5. **Given** error contains email/password, **When** logged, **Then** PII is scrubbed before sending
6. **Given** error severity (info, warning, error, fatal), **When** classified, **Then** appropriate level set in monitoring

---

### User Story 2 - Session Replay (Priority: P2)

A developer debugs a user-reported issue by watching a replay of the user's session leading up to the error.

**Why this priority**: Session replay dramatically reduces debugging time but requires significant consent considerations.

**Independent Test**: Enable session recording, perform actions, trigger error, verify replay captures actions with sensitive inputs masked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** error occurred, **When** viewing in monitoring dashboard, **Then** session replay shows user actions leading to error
2. **Given** password or credit card field, **When** user types in it, **Then** input value masked in recording
3. **Given** session recording enabled, **When** user opts out, **Then** recording stops immediately
4. **Given** recording storage, **When** retention period expires, **Then** old recordings deleted automatically
5. **Given** error report, **When** linked to session, **Then** developer can jump to error moment in replay

---

### User Story 3 - Toast Notifications (Priority: P1)

A user receives clear, friendly notifications when errors occur or actions complete successfully, without being overwhelmed.

**Why this priority**: User-facing error communication directly impacts user experience. Users need to know when something went wrong.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a recoverable error, verify toast appears with friendly message and dismiss/retry options.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** recoverable error (e.g., network timeout), **When** displayed, **Then** toast shows user-friendly message with retry option
2. **Given** successful action (e.g., save complete), **When** finished, **Then** success toast briefly shown
3. **Given** warning condition (e.g., session expiring), **When** detected, **Then** warning toast displayed
4. **Given** multiple toasts queued, **When** displayed, **Then** shown sequentially without overlap
5. **Given** toast displayed, **When** auto-dismiss timer expires, **Then** toast fades away smoothly
6. **Given** toast with action button, **When** clicked, **Then** action executes and toast dismisses

---

### User Story 4 - Error Boundaries (Priority: P1)

A user encounters a component crash but the rest of the application continues working, with option to retry the failed component.

**Why this priority**: Error boundaries prevent total app crashes. Critical for user experience when errors occur.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a component error, verify fallback UI displays with retry option while rest of app functions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** component throws during render, **When** caught by boundary, **Then** fallback UI shown instead of blank screen
2. **Given** error boundary triggered, **When** error captured, **Then** error sent to monitoring service (if consented)
3. **Given** recoverable error, **When** retry button clicked, **Then** component attempts to re-render
4. **Given** critical/unrecoverable error, **When** detected, **Then** user redirected to error page
5. **Given** no consent for monitoring, **When** error boundary catches error, **Then** fallback UI still works (local only)

### Edge Cases

**Consent & Initialization Edge Cases**:

- User withdraws consent after monitoring initialized (stop recording, stop sending)
- User grants consent mid-session (initialize services, start capturing)
- Consent cookie deleted/expired (re-prompt, don't send until consented)
- Error occurs before consent determined (queue locally, send after consent)

**Error Logging Edge Cases**:

- Circular references in error context objects
- Very long error messages (truncation)
- Errors during error handling (prevent infinite loops)
- Rapid-fire errors (rate limiting to prevent spam)
- Offline when error occurs (queue for later)

**Session Replay Edge Cases**:

- Very long sessions (chunking, storage limits)
- User switches tabs frequently (handle visibility changes)
- Copy-paste of sensitive data (mask clipboard content)
- Third-party iframes (cross-origin restrictions)

**Toast Notification Edge Cases**:

- Screen reader announcement of toast content
- Toast appears during modal open (z-index, focus management)
- Very long toast messages (truncation, expand option)
- Toast action fails (show error, allow retry)
- Mobile viewport (position, size adjustments)

**Error Boundary Edge Cases**:

- Error in error boundary itself (parent boundary catches)
- Multiple nested boundaries (closest catches first)
- Error during async operations (boundaries only catch render errors)
- SSR errors vs client errors (different handling)

## Dependencies

- **019-Google Analytics**: Analytics consent framework (consent required before monitoring)
- **002-Cookie Consent**: Cookie consent banner and preferences
- **003-User Authentication**: User context for error reports

## Out of Scope

- Custom monitoring dashboards and visualizations
- Alerting rules and notification configuration
- On-call rotation and escalation setup
- Performance monitoring features (separate from error tracking)
- Mobile app crash reporting (web only)
- Third-party service account setup and billing

## Assumptions

- User consent system (019) is implemented and provides consent status
- Monitoring service accounts are created and API keys available
- Application uses a component-based architecture with error boundary support
- Users prefer brief, actionable error messages over technical details
- Session replay storage costs are acceptable for debugging value
- GDPR/CCPA compliance is handled at the consent framework level
