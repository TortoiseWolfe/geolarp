## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Send Friend Request to Start Conversation (Priority: P1)

A user wants to connect with another user on the platform to enable messaging. They search for the user by username or email and send a friend request.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the messaging system. Without connections, no messaging can occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating two users, having one search for and send a friend request to the other, and verifying the request appears in the recipient's pending requests list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I search for a user by username, **Then** I see matching users in the search results
2. **Given** I found a user in search, **When** I click "Send Request", **Then** the request is sent and button shows "Request Sent"
3. **Given** I received a friend request, **When** I view my requests, **Then** I see the requester's name and avatar with Accept/Decline buttons
4. **Given** I received a friend request, **When** I click "Accept", **Then** we become connected and can message each other
5. **Given** I received a friend request, **When** I click "Decline", **Then** the request is removed and we remain unconnected
6. **Given** I want to prevent contact, **When** I click "Block" on a user, **Then** they cannot send me requests or messages

---

### User Story 2 - Send Encrypted Message to Connection (Priority: P1)

A user with established connections wants to send a private message to a friend. The message must be end-to-end encrypted so only the sender and recipient can read it.

**Why this priority**: This is the core messaging functionality. Without the ability to send/receive encrypted messages, the feature provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by establishing a connection between two users, having one send an encrypted message, and verifying the recipient receives and can decrypt the message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am connected with a user, **When** I open a conversation, **Then** I see a message input and send button
2. **Given** I am composing a message, **When** I type text and click "Send", **Then** the message is encrypted client-side and sent to the server
3. **Given** my friend sent me a message, **When** I open the conversation, **Then** the encrypted message is decrypted client-side and displayed in plaintext
4. **Given** a message was sent, **When** it appears in the conversation, **Then** I see a timestamp and delivery status (sent/delivered/read)
5. **Given** the server receives an encrypted message, **When** database admins query the message, **Then** they only see encrypted ciphertext (zero-knowledge verified)
6. **Given** I sent a message, **When** my friend reads it, **Then** I see read receipts (double checkmark) on my message

---

### User Story 3 - Real-time Message Delivery (Priority: P1)

A user expects to receive messages instantly without refreshing the page. The system uses Supabase Realtime to push new messages to the recipient within 500ms.

**Why this priority**: Real-time delivery is essential for a modern chat experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the same conversation in two browser windows, sending a message from one window, and verifying it appears in the other window within 500ms without refresh.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a conversation open, **When** my friend sends me a message, **Then** the message appears in my thread within 500ms without refresh
2. **Given** I am typing a message, **When** I type for >1 second, **Then** my friend sees "[Username] is typing..." indicator
3. **Given** my friend stops typing, **When** 3 seconds pass, **Then** the typing indicator disappears
4. **Given** I sent a message, **When** my friend's app receives it, **Then** the message shows "delivered" status on my end
5. **Given** my friend reads my message, **When** they view the conversation, **Then** my message shows "read" status (double blue checkmark)

### User Story 4 - Edit or Delete Message Within 15-Minute Window (Priority: P2)

A user wants to correct a typo, clarify a message, or unsend a message sent by mistake. They can edit or delete the message within 15 minutes.

**Why this priority**: Message editing and deletion improve user experience by allowing corrections and unsending mistakes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I sent a message <15 minutes ago, **When** I long-press the message, **Then** I see "Edit" and "Delete" options in the menu
2. **Given** I clicked "Edit", **When** I modify the text and save, **Then** the message updates with "Edited 2m ago" indicator
3. **Given** I clicked "Delete", **When** I confirm deletion, **Then** the message shows "[Message deleted]" to both users
4. **Given** I edited a message, **When** my friend views it, **Then** they see the updated version with "Edited" label
5. **Given** I sent a message 16 minutes ago, **When** I try to edit or delete it, **Then** both options are disabled/hidden
6. **Given** I deleted a message, **When** I try to edit it, **Then** edit is not allowed

---

### User Story 5 - Offline Message Queue and Sync (Priority: P2)

A user loses internet connection while composing a message. The app queues the message locally in IndexedDB and automatically sends it when the connection is restored.

**Why this priority**: Offline support ensures message reliability and improves UX in areas with poor connectivity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am offline, **When** I send a message, **Then** it is stored in IndexedDB queue and shows "Sending..." status
2. **Given** I have queued messages, **When** I reconnect to the internet, **Then** all queued messages send automatically
3. **Given** I am offline, **When** I view past conversations, **Then** I see cached messages from IndexedDB
4. **Given** a queued message fails to send 5 times, **When** retry limit is reached, **Then** the message shows "Failed to send" with retry button
5. **Given** I sent a message while offline, **When** it syncs and delivers, **Then** the status updates from "Sending..." to "Delivered"

---

### User Story 6 - Read Conversation History with Virtual Scrolling (Priority: P3)

A user with 1,000+ messages in a conversation wants to scroll through the entire history. The app uses virtual scrolling to render only visible messages for performance.

**Why this priority**: This is important for long-term users with extensive message histories but not critical for initial launch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have 1,000+ messages in a conversation, **When** I scroll through history, **Then** the app maintains 60fps scrolling
2. **Given** I scroll to the top, **When** I reach the oldest messages, **Then** the app loads the next 50 older messages (pagination)
3. **Given** I am viewing old messages, **When** a new message arrives, **Then** a "New message" indicator appears with scroll-to-bottom button
4. **Given** I scroll to an arbitrary position, **When** I navigate away and back, **Then** the scroll position is preserved
5. **Given** messages load incrementally, **When** encryption keys are cached, **Then** decryption happens within 50ms per message

---

### User Story 7 - GDPR Data Export and Deletion (Priority: P3)

A user wants to exercise their GDPR rights to export all their message history or delete their account with all associated data.

**Why this priority**: While legally required in EU, this can be implemented after MVP launch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in settings, **When** I click "Export Data", **Then** I receive a JSON file with all my decrypted conversations
2. **Given** I click "Delete Account", **When** I confirm deletion, **Then** all my messages, connections, and encryption keys are permanently deleted
3. **Given** I deleted my account, **When** other users view old conversations, **Then** my messages show "[User deleted account]" placeholder
4. **Given** I export my data, **When** I open the JSON file, **Then** I see human-readable message content (decrypted), not ciphertext

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** a user tries to message someone who blocked them?
  - Messages remain visible as read-only history. Banner displays "[User] blocked you" at top of conversation, message input is disabled.

- **How does the system handle** lost encryption keys (user clears browser data)?
  - All past messages become unrecoverable. New keys are generated on next message send. User sees warning: "Previous messages cannot be decrypted."

- **What happens when** a user tries to send a message but the recipient has no encryption keys yet?
  - Sender sees: "This user hasn't set up encryption yet. They'll receive your message when they reply." Message is queued locally.

- **What happens when** two users send messages simultaneously while offline?
  - Both messages queue locally, sync when online. Server sequence numbers ensure correct ordering. No message loss.

- **How does the system handle** very long messages (>10,000 characters)?
  - Client validates and shows error: "Message too long (10,000 char max)". Message is not sent.
