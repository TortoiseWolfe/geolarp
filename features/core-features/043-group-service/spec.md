## Implementation Status

**Last audited**: 2026-04-25
**Real status**: Partial
**Tracking**: see gap-audit GitHub issues + STATUS.md

### Shipped

- src/services/messaging/group-service.ts — 8 stub methods at lines 338, 348, 357, 366, 375, 384, 394, 403

### Gaps

- addMembers — stubbed
- getMembers — stubbed
- removeMember — stubbed
- leaveGroup — stubbed
- transferOwnership — stubbed
- upgradeToGroup — stubbed
- renameGroup — stubbed
- deleteGroup — stubbed

### Notes

- Backing work for 011 group-chats UI. Group creation works; member operations are the gap.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Add Members to Group (Priority: P1)

As a group owner, I can add new members to my group so they can participate in the conversation.

**Why this priority**: Core group functionality - enables group growth and collaboration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a group and adding a new member, verifying they appear in member list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a group owner, **When** adding valid users, **Then** users become group members
2. **Given** a non-owner member, **When** attempting to add members, **Then** operation is denied with clear message
3. **Given** an owner adding invalid user identifiers, **When** the request is made, **Then** error returned with details
4. **Given** successful member addition, **When** complete, **Then** new and existing members are notified

---

### User Story 2 - Remove Member / Leave Group (Priority: P1)

As a group member, I can leave a group, and as an owner, I can remove members from my group.

**Why this priority**: Essential for group management - members need exit paths, owners need moderation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having an owner remove a member and verifying they no longer appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a group owner, **When** removing a member, **Then** member is removed from group
2. **Given** any group member, **When** choosing to leave, **Then** their membership ends
3. **Given** an owner who is the only owner, **When** attempting to leave, **Then** system requires ownership transfer first
4. **Given** member removal or departure, **When** complete, **Then** affected user is notified

---

### User Story 3 - Group Management (Priority: P2)

As a group owner, I can rename my group, transfer ownership, or delete the group entirely.

**Why this priority**: Administrative functions - less frequent but necessary for group lifecycle.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by renaming a group and verifying the new name displays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a group owner, **When** renaming the group, **Then** name is updated for all members
2. **Given** a group owner, **When** transferring ownership to a member, **Then** that member becomes the new owner
3. **Given** ownership transfer, **When** complete, **Then** both previous and new owner are notified
4. **Given** a group owner, **When** deleting the group, **Then** group is archived and members notified

---

### User Story 4 - Upgrade Direct Message to Group (Priority: P2)

As a user in a direct message conversation, I can upgrade it to a group to add more participants.

**Why this priority**: Convenience feature - saves creating new group when expanding existing conversation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by upgrading a DM and adding a third person.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a direct message conversation, **When** upgrade is requested, **Then** it becomes a group conversation
2. **Given** an upgraded conversation, **When** a third user is added, **Then** group functions correctly
3. **Given** an upgraded group, **When** viewing history, **Then** all previous messages are preserved
4. **Given** upgrade completes, **When** viewing the conversation, **Then** all original participants are notified

### Edge Cases

- What if owner tries to remove themselves?
  - Denied - must transfer ownership or leave properly

- What if someone removes the last admin?
  - Owner always remains; cannot remove owner

- What if the group name is too long or contains invalid characters?
  - Validation with clear error message and length limits

- What if network fails during member removal?
  - Transaction rolls back; member remains in group

- What if user is added who is already a member?
  - No-op with success response (idempotent)

- What if ownership is transferred to non-member?
  - Denied - new owner must be existing member

- What if deleted group is accessed?
  - Archived view with no interaction capabilities

- What if all members leave a group?
  - Group becomes inactive/orphaned; cleaned up by system

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Security**

### Key Entities

- **Group Conversation**: A conversation with type "group" supporting multiple members

- **Member**: A user belonging to a group with a role (owner, admin, or member)

- **Ownership**: The designation of which member has full administrative control

- **Member Role**: Permission level within group (owner > admin > member)

---

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All 8 group operations (add, get, remove, leave, transfer, upgrade, rename, delete) are functional
- **SC-002**: 100% of operations enforce permission checks
- **SC-003**: Notifications sent for all member-affecting operations
- **SC-004**: Message access correctly updated on all membership changes
- **SC-005**: All group operations complete within 500ms (95th percentile)
- **SC-006**: Zero permission bypass vulnerabilities

---

## Constraints _(optional)_

- Operations are backend services, not UI components
- Soft delete required for groups (no permanent data loss)
- Audit logging required for compliance

---

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Requires Feature 009 (user-messaging-system) for base messaging infrastructure
- Requires Feature 011 (group-chats) for group conversation support

---

## Assumptions _(optional)_

- Authentication system provides verified user identity
- Messaging system has group conversation type already defined
- Notification system is available for member alerts
- Audit logging infrastructure exists
