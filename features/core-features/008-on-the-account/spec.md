## Overview

User avatar upload functionality enabling authenticated users to personalize their profiles with custom profile pictures. Includes upload, crop, replace, and remove capabilities with full accessibility compliance.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Upload New Avatar (Priority: P1)

A user visits their Account Settings page and wants to personalize their profile by uploading a profile picture.

**Why this priority**: Core MVP functionality - without the ability to upload an avatar, the feature doesn't exist. This is the fundamental user value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to Account Settings, clicking upload button, selecting an image file, and verifying the avatar displays in the UI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is logged in and on Account Settings page, **When** user clicks "Upload Avatar" button, **Then** file picker dialog opens
2. **Given** file picker is open, **When** user selects a valid image file (JPEG/PNG/WebP under 5MB), **Then** crop interface displays with image preview
3. **Given** crop interface is showing, **When** user positions/frames the image and clicks "Save", **Then** cropped avatar is uploaded to storage and displays as user's profile picture
4. **Given** avatar upload succeeded, **When** user navigates away and returns, **Then** their avatar persists and displays correctly

---

### User Story 2 - Replace Existing Avatar (Priority: P2)

A user with an existing avatar wants to change it to a different image.

**Why this priority**: Natural follow-on to P1 - users will want to update avatars over time. Enhances the initial MVP.

**Independent Test**: Upload an initial avatar (P1), then upload a different image and verify the new one replaces the old one completely.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user already has an avatar set, **When** user uploads a new avatar, **Then** new avatar replaces the old one
2. **Given** new avatar was uploaded, **When** system completes upload, **Then** old avatar file is immediately deleted from storage

---

### User Story 3 - Remove Avatar (Priority: P3)

A user wants to remove their custom avatar and revert to a default state.

**Why this priority**: Less common use case but necessary for user control and privacy. Users should be able to remove personal images.

**Independent Test**: Upload an avatar, then use a "Remove Avatar" action and verify avatar is deleted and user sees default avatar or initials.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has a custom avatar, **When** user clicks "Remove Avatar", **Then** system deletes the avatar file and reverts to default avatar
2. **Given** avatar was removed, **When** user views their profile elsewhere in app, **Then** default avatar displays consistently

---

### Edge Cases

**Invalid File Types**:

- User uploads PDF, GIF, TIFF or other non-supported format
- System displays clear error: "Please upload a JPEG, PNG, or WebP image"

**File Size Exceeded**:

- User uploads file larger than 5MB
- System displays clear error: "Image must be under 5MB. Please choose a smaller file or compress your image"

**Upload Failure**:

- Network interruption during file transfer
- System displays error with retry option: "Upload failed. Check your connection and try again"
- Partial uploads are cleaned up (no orphaned files)

**No Avatar State**:

- User never uploads an avatar
- System displays default avatar (user initials in styled circle)

**Filename Collisions**:

- Two users upload same filename simultaneously
- System generates unique filenames using `{user_id}-{timestamp}.webp` pattern

**Image Dimension Constraints**:

- Images smaller than 200x200 pixels: Rejected with message "Image must be at least 200x200 pixels"
- Images extremely large (10000x10000): Processed normally via client-side resize before upload

**Storage Quota**:

- Storage bucket reaches capacity
- System displays error: "Unable to upload at this time. Please try again later"
- Admin notification triggered for capacity management

**Crop Interface Abandonment**:

- User opens crop interface but closes without saving
- No changes made, original avatar (if any) preserved

**Minimum Crop Area**:

- User tries to select crop area smaller than 200x200 pixels
- Crop tool enforces minimum selection size visually

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Upload Interface**:

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an "Upload Avatar" button on the Account Settings page
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept image files in JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats only
- **FR-003**: System MUST reject files larger than 5MB with clear error message

**Storage & Persistence**:

- **FR-010**: System MUST store avatar images in Supabase Storage bucket
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate unique filenames using `{user_id}-{timestamp}.webp` pattern
- **FR-012**: System MUST update user profile record with avatar URL after successful upload

### Key Entities

- Storage: Supabase Storage bucket with public read, authenticated write

**Avatar Metadata**:

- Information about the uploaded image for debugging and audit
- Attributes: Original filename, MIME type, file size, original dimensions, processed dimensions, upload timestamp

- **SC-002**: System successfully processes and stores 100% of valid image uploads (JPEG/PNG/WebP under 5MB)
- **SC-003**: System correctly rejects 100% of invalid uploads with clear, specific error messages
- **SC-004**: Avatar upload interface passes WCAG 2.1 AA automated accessibility testing
- **SC-005**: Uploaded avatars display consistently across all pages where user profile appears
- **SC-006**: 90% of users successfully upload an avatar on their first attempt without needing support
- **SC-007**: System handles 50 concurrent avatar uploads without errors or degradation
- **SC-008**: Storage costs remain under $5/month with 1000 active users

---

## Dependencies

- **003-User Authentication**: Users must be authenticated to access Account Settings
- **000-RLS Implementation**: Avatar storage must respect RLS policies for write access

## Out of Scope

- Webcam photo capture (future enhancement)
- Advanced avatar editing (rotate, filter, effects) - basic crop only
- Multiple avatars per user or avatar history
- Avatar approval/moderation workflow
- AI-generated avatars or avatar marketplace
- Social avatar imports (Facebook, Twitter, Gravatar integration)

## Assumptions

- Users have modern browsers supporting HTML5 File API and Canvas API
- Supabase Storage bucket exists and is configured appropriately
- Client-side image processing reduces server load and storage bandwidth
- Animated images (animated WebP) are converted to static frame (first frame extracted)
- 800x800px output size provides good quality while maintaining reasonable file sizes

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: What happens to old avatar when replaced? → A: Immediately delete (save storage costs, no history)
- Q: How to validate uploaded files are genuine images? → A: Attempt image processing/decoding (catches corrupted files)
- Q: How to handle non-square aspect ratios? → A: Allow users to crop/position before upload (best control)
