## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!-- User stories reordered per UX_FLOW_ORDER.md (2026-01-16):
     Follows pipeline flow: Write Tests → Orchestrate → Execute → Debug -->

### User Story 1 - Critical User Journey Testing (Priority: P0) [Pipeline: Input]

As a developer, I need to test complete user workflows (not just individual components) so that I can catch integration issues that unit tests miss.

**Why this priority**: User journey testing validates the entire stack working together. This is the fundamental value proposition of E2E tests.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by writing a journey test that spans multiple pages and user interactions. Delivers confidence in integrated behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user journey test exists, **When** I run it, **Then** it navigates through multiple pages and validates state across the workflow
2. **Given** the journey involves form submission, **When** the test runs, **Then** it fills forms, submits, and verifies the result
3. **Given** the journey requires authentication, **When** the test runs, **Then** it can log in and access protected routes

---

### User Story 2 - CI/CD Integration (Priority: P0) [Pipeline: Orchestration]

As a developer, I need E2E tests to run automatically on pull requests so that regressions are caught before merge.

**Why this priority**: Automated testing on PRs is essential for maintaining quality at scale.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a PR and verifying the E2E workflow runs. Delivers automated quality gates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open a pull request, **When** CI runs, **Then** E2E tests execute automatically
2. **Given** E2E tests fail, **When** I view the CI results, **Then** I see clear failure reports with screenshots
3. **Given** tests pass, **When** I view the CI results, **Then** I see execution time and browser coverage

---

### User Story 3 - Cross-Browser Test Execution (Priority: P0) [Pipeline: Execution]

As a developer, I need to run E2E tests across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari so that I can ensure the application works consistently for all users regardless of their browser choice.

**Why this priority**: Cross-browser compatibility is the core purpose of E2E testing. Without this, the framework provides no value over unit tests.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `test:e2e` command and verifying tests execute in all three browser engines. Delivers cross-browser validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** E2E tests exist, **When** I run the test command, **Then** tests execute in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. **Given** tests are running, **When** a test fails in one browser, **Then** the failure is clearly attributed to that specific browser
3. **Given** I want faster feedback, **When** I run tests locally, **Then** I can target a single browser using a flag

---

### User Story 4 - Test Debugging (Priority: P2) [Pipeline: Output]

As a developer, I need tools to debug failing tests (traces, screenshots, video) so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

**Why this priority**: Debugging tools significantly reduce time to fix flaky or failing tests.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by intentionally failing a test and inspecting the debug artifacts. Delivers faster debugging.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a test fails, **When** I view the report, **Then** I see a screenshot of the failure state
2. **Given** a test fails in CI, **When** I download artifacts, **Then** I get video and trace files
3. **Given** I want to debug locally, **When** I run with debug flag, **Then** I get step-by-step execution with browser DevTools

---

### User Story 5 - Theme Switching Validation (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to test that theme switching works correctly and persists across page reloads so that users have a consistent visual experience.

**Why this priority**: Theme switching is a key UX feature that must work across browsers and persist correctly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching themes, reloading, and verifying persistence. Delivers theme reliability validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I switch to a different theme, **Then** the theme is applied immediately
2. **Given** I have selected a theme, **When** I reload the page, **Then** my theme choice persists
3. **Given** I am testing themes, **When** I switch themes, **Then** all UI elements reflect the new theme colors

---

### User Story 6 - PWA Feature Testing (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to test PWA capabilities including service worker registration and offline functionality so that the app works reliably as an installable application.

**Why this priority**: PWA features cannot be tested with unit tests and require real browser behavior validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying service worker registration and testing offline mode. Delivers PWA quality assurance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** the page loads, **Then** the service worker is registered
2. **Given** the PWA manifest exists, **When** I inspect it, **Then** it has correct name, icons, and display mode
3. **Given** I have visited pages while online, **When** I go offline and reload, **Then** cached pages still display

---

### User Story 7 - Accessibility Testing (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to test that keyboard navigation and screen reader landmarks work correctly so that the application is usable by people with disabilities.

**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a constitutional requirement (WCAG AA) and E2E tests can validate real keyboard/focus behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by tabbing through the application and verifying focus order. Delivers accessibility validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am using keyboard navigation, **When** I press Tab, **Then** focus moves in a logical order
2. **Given** focus is on an interactive element, **When** I press Enter or Space, **Then** the element activates
3. **Given** a modal is open, **When** I press Escape, **Then** the modal closes and focus returns

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a test times out waiting for an element?
  - Test fails with clear timeout message indicating which selector/action timed out

- How does the system handle network failures during test execution?
  - Tests can mock network conditions; real failures are caught and reported as infrastructure issues

- What happens when the dev server fails to start?
  - Test run fails fast with clear message about web server startup failure

- How are flaky tests handled?
  - CI retries failed tests up to 2 times; repeated flakiness flagged for investigation

- What happens when browser installation is missing in CI?
  - Playwright installs browsers as part of CI setup; failure results in clear installation error

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-30

- Taxonomy analysis completed: All categories Clear
- Developer infrastructure feature - no end-user UI (wireframe will be architectural diagram)
- Test organization follows feature/journey structure per file naming convention
- Parallelization scales with available CPU cores (workers: undefined = auto)
