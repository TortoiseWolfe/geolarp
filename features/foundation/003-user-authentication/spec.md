## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Email/Password Registration (Priority: P0)

As a new user, I need to create an account using my email and password so that I can securely access payment features and maintain my own payment history.

**Why this priority**: Account creation is the foundational entry point. Without registration, users cannot access any protected features. This is the minimum viable authentication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the signup flow end-to-end: enter email/password → receive verification email → click link → account verified. Delivers secure account creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I click "Sign Up" and enter a valid email and strong password, **Then** my account is created and I receive a verification email
2. **Given** I receive the verification email, **When** I click the verification link within 24 hours, **Then** my email is confirmed and I can sign in
3. **Given** I try to sign up with an existing email, **When** I submit the form, **Then** I see "Email already registered. Please sign in or reset password."

---

### User Story 2 - User Sign In (Priority: P0)

As a registered user, I need to sign in with my credentials so that I can access my payment history and make new payments.

**Why this priority**: Sign-in is essential for returning users. Combined with Story 1, this completes the basic authentication loop.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing in with valid credentials and verifying access to protected dashboard. Delivers session-based access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a verified account, **When** I enter correct email and password, **Then** I am signed in and redirected to my dashboard
2. **Given** I am signing in, **When** I check "Remember Me", **Then** my session remains active for 30 days
3. **Given** I don't check "Remember Me", **When** I sign in, **Then** my session expires after 7 days
4. **Given** I enter incorrect credentials 5 times, **When** I try again, **Then** I am locked out for 15 minutes

---

### User Story 3 - Password Reset (Priority: P1)

As a user who forgot my password, I need to reset it via email so that I can regain access to my account.

**Why this priority**: Password recovery is critical for user retention. Without it, locked-out users have no recourse.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting reset → receiving email → clicking link → setting new password → signing in with new password. Delivers account recovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I forgot my password, **When** I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email, **Then** I receive a password reset link
2. **Given** I receive the reset link, **When** I click it within 1 hour and enter a new valid password, **Then** my password is updated
3. **Given** I have a reset link, **When** I try to use it after 1 hour, **Then** I see "Link expired" and can request a new one

---

### User Story 4 - OAuth Sign In (Priority: P1)

As a user who prefers not to manage another password, I need to sign in using GitHub or Google so that I can authenticate quickly and securely.

**Why this priority**: OAuth reduces friction and improves conversion for users who trust third-party providers. Supports developer-focused user base (GitHub).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking OAuth button → authorizing on provider → returning with authenticated session. Delivers passwordless authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I prefer OAuth, **When** I click "Sign in with GitHub", **Then** I am redirected to GitHub to authorize
2. **Given** I authorize on GitHub, **When** I return to ScriptHammer, **Then** I am automatically signed in
3. **Given** I prefer Google, **When** I click "Sign in with Google" and authorize, **Then** I am signed in via Google

---

### User Story 5 - Protected Route Access (Priority: P0)

As a system, I need to protect payment routes from unauthenticated access so that user financial data remains secure.

**Why this priority**: Security is non-negotiable for payment features. This story ensures the authentication system actually protects resources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to access /payments while logged out (redirected) and while logged in (granted). Delivers route protection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am NOT signed in, **When** I try to access the payment page, **Then** I am redirected to sign-in
2. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I access the payment page, **Then** I see my payments and can make new ones
3. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I view payment history, **Then** I see only MY transactions (not other users')

---

### User Story 6 - Profile Management (Priority: P2)

As a registered user, I need to manage my profile and account settings so that I can update my information or delete my account.

**Why this priority**: Profile management enhances user experience but is not essential for core payment functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing profile → updating display name → verifying change persists. Delivers user self-service.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I view my profile, **Then** I see my email, display name, and avatar
2. **Given** I am on my profile, **When** I update my display name, **Then** the change is saved
3. **Given** I want to leave, **When** I delete my account, **Then** all my data (including payment history) is deleted

---

### User Story 7 - Unverified User Handling (Priority: P1)

As an unverified user, I need clear guidance to verify my email so that I can access payment features.

**Why this priority**: Prevents user confusion and abandonment when verification is incomplete.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing up without verifying → attempting payment access → seeing verification prompt. Delivers clear user guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am signed in but unverified, **When** I try to access payments, **Then** I am redirected to verification page
2. **Given** I am on the verification page, **When** I click "Resend", **Then** a new verification email is sent
3. **Given** my verification link expired, **When** I click it, **Then** I see "Link expired" with option to resend

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to sign up with an email that already exists?
  - System shows error: "Email already registered. Please sign in or reset password."

- How does the system handle expired verification links?
  - System shows error and provides option to resend verification email

- What happens when email delivery fails for verification or password reset?
  - System shows error immediately: "Failed to send email. Please try again." with retry button

- What happens when a user's session expires while viewing payment history?
  - System redirects to sign-in page: "Session expired. Please sign in again."

- How does the system prevent brute force password attacks?
  - System limits login attempts to 5 per 15 minutes per email address

- What happens when a user tries to access someone else's payment data?
  - System returns empty results (RLS policies prevent unauthorized access)

- What happens if OAuth provider is unavailable?
  - System shows error: "Unable to connect to [Provider]. Please try again or use email/password."
