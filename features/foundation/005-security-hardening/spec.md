## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!-- User stories reordered per UX_FLOW_ORDER.md (2026-01-16):
     UX-visible stories follow form top-to-bottom flow: Email → Password → Lockout → Recovery
     Backend stories grouped by priority -->

### User Story 1 - Email Validation (Priority: P1) [UX: Form Field 1]

As a user signing up, I need my email address to be properly validated so that I can receive account communications and recover my account if needed.

**Why this priority**: Invalid emails prevent account recovery and enable abuse. Proper validation improves account quality while warning about potentially problematic addresses.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting various valid and invalid email formats and verifying appropriate acceptance or rejection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I enter an email without a valid domain extension, **When** I submit, **Then** the email is rejected with a clear error
2. **Given** I enter an email with invalid formatting, **When** I submit, **Then** the email is rejected
3. **Given** I enter an email from a temporary/disposable service, **When** I submit, **Then** I see a warning but can proceed
4. **Given** I enter a valid email, **When** I submit, **Then** the email is accepted and normalized

---

### User Story 2 - Password Strength Guidance (Priority: P2) [UX: Form Field 2]

As a user creating a password, I need real-time feedback on password strength so that I can create a secure password without frustration.

**Why this priority**: Users often choose weak passwords without understanding requirements. Visual feedback improves security awareness and reduces weak passwords.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by typing various passwords and verifying strength indicator updates appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am creating a password, **When** I type, **Then** I see real-time strength feedback (weak/medium/strong)
2. **Given** my password is weak, **When** I view the form, **Then** I see clear requirements to improve it
3. **Given** I create a strong password, **When** the system validates it, **Then** I receive positive confirmation
4. **Given** I create a weak password, **When** I submit, **Then** the form educates me but does not block submission

---

### User Story 3 - Brute Force Attack Prevention (Priority: P0) [UX: Failure State]

As a user, I need the system to prevent attackers from guessing my password by blocking repeated failed attempts server-side so that my account remains secure regardless of attacker behavior.

**Why this priority**: Client-side rate limiting can be easily bypassed. Server-side enforcement is required for actual security against brute force attacks.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting 6+ failed logins, clearing browser data, switching browsers, and verifying blocking still applies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an attacker tries to guess my password, **When** they make 5 failed attempts, **Then** further attempts are blocked
2. **Given** the attacker clears their browser data, **When** they try again, **Then** they are still blocked
3. **Given** the attacker uses a different browser, **When** they try again, **Then** they are still blocked
4. **Given** I am legitimately locked out, **When** the lockout period expires, **Then** I can try again
5. **Given** I am locked out, **When** I view the sign-in form, **Then** I see clear feedback on lockout duration and remaining attempts

---

### User Story 4 - Authentication Error Recovery (Priority: P2) [UX: Recovery Link]

As a user experiencing authentication failures, I need clear error messages and recovery options so that I am not left confused or stuck.

**Why this priority**: Poor error handling leaves users frustrated and increases support burden. Clear recovery paths improve user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering various authentication failures and verifying helpful error messages and recovery options appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the OAuth provider is unavailable, **When** I try to sign in, **Then** I see a clear error and can retry or use alternative methods
2. **Given** email delivery fails during sign-up, **When** I am notified, **Then** I can request a new verification email
3. **Given** a payment status update fails, **When** the system retries, **Then** I eventually see the correct status
4. **Given** any authentication error occurs, **When** I view the error, **Then** I understand what happened and what to do next

---

### User Story 5 - Payment Data Isolation (Priority: P0) [Backend]

As a user with payment history, I need my payment data to be completely isolated from other users so that my financial information cannot be accessed by anyone else.

**Why this priority**: Payment data leakage is a critical security and compliance violation. Without proper user association, data can leak between accounts, violating privacy and financial regulations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating payment data for User A, then attempting to access it as User B and verifying access is denied.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am User A with payment history, **When** User B signs in, **Then** User B cannot see or access any of my payment data
2. **Given** I create a payment, **When** the system stores it, **Then** it is permanently associated with my user account only
3. **Given** I view my payment history, **When** results are displayed, **Then** only payments belonging to my account are shown
4. **Given** an unauthenticated request attempts to access payments, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the request is rejected

---

### User Story 6 - OAuth Account Protection (Priority: P0) [Backend]

As a user signing in with a third-party provider, I need the authentication flow to verify that the callback belongs to my browser session so that attackers cannot hijack my account.

**Why this priority**: OAuth hijacking (CSRF) allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to victim accounts. This is a critical vulnerability that must be prevented.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by initiating an OAuth flow, then attempting to complete it in a different browser session and verifying the callback is rejected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an attacker initiates an OAuth flow, **When** they try to redirect the authorization to a victim's browser, **Then** the victim's account is NOT compromised
2. **Given** I sign in with a third-party provider, **When** the callback completes, **Then** the system verifies the request originated from my browser session
3. **Given** someone tries to replay an authorization code, **When** they submit it, **Then** the system rejects it as already used
4. **Given** the session verification fails, **When** the callback is processed, **Then** authentication is denied with a clear error

---

### User Story 7 - CSRF Protection (Priority: P0) [Backend]

As a user, I need all state-changing operations to be protected against cross-site request forgery so that malicious websites cannot trick me into performing unwanted actions.

**Why this priority**: Without CSRF protection, attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions via malicious websites.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a form without a valid token and verifying the request is rejected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I submit a sign-up form, **When** the form lacks a valid security token, **Then** the request is rejected
2. **Given** I update my profile, **When** the request includes a valid token, **Then** the update succeeds
3. **Given** I initiate a payment, **When** the request authenticity cannot be verified, **Then** the payment is rejected
4. **Given** a token has been used, **When** it is resubmitted, **Then** the request is rejected

---

### User Story 8 - Malicious Data Prevention (Priority: P1) [Backend]

As a system operator, I need user-submitted data to be validated against injection attacks so that malicious content cannot compromise system security or stability.

**Why this priority**: Malicious metadata can cause application-wide security vulnerabilities, crashes, or resource exhaustion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting data with dangerous patterns and verifying rejection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an attacker submits data with dangerous object keys, **When** the system validates it, **Then** the request is rejected
2. **Given** data contains circular references, **When** the system validates it, **Then** it detects and rejects the invalid structure
3. **Given** data exceeds size limits, **When** the system validates it, **Then** the request is rejected
4. **Given** data is nested too deeply, **When** the system validates it, **Then** the request is rejected

---

### User Story 9 - Security Audit Trail (Priority: P1) [Backend]

As a security administrator, I need all authentication events to be logged with sufficient detail so that I can investigate security incidents and meet compliance requirements.

**Why this priority**: Without audit logs, security incidents cannot be investigated, and compliance requirements (privacy regulations, financial standards) are not met.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing authentication actions and verifying events appear in the audit log with correct details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user signs in successfully, **When** the authentication completes, **Then** the event is logged with timestamp, user identifier, and connection details
2. **Given** a sign-in attempt fails, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the failed attempt is logged for security review
3. **Given** a user signs out, **When** the session ends, **Then** the sign-out is logged
4. **Given** an admin reviews security logs, **When** they query recent events, **Then** they see a complete audit trail
5. **Given** logs are created, **When** 90 days pass, **Then** logs are still available for compliance review

---

### User Story 10 - Session Timeout (Priority: P2) [See: 02-session-timeout-warning.svg]

As a user, I need my session to automatically expire after inactivity so that if I leave my device unattended, my account is protected.

**Why this priority**: Users often leave devices unlocked. Idle timeout reduces risk of physical access to accounts while balancing usability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by leaving a session idle for the timeout period and verifying automatic sign-out occurs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am signed in normally, **When** I am inactive for 24 hours, **Then** my session expires
2. **Given** I selected "Remember Me", **When** I am inactive for 7 days, **Then** my session expires
3. **Given** my session is about to expire, **When** 1 minute remains, **Then** I am warned
4. **Given** I interact with the application, **When** the inactivity timer is running, **Then** it resets
5. **Given** I explicitly sign out, **When** the sign-out completes, **Then** my session is fully terminated

---

### User Story 11 - Pre-commit Secret Detection (Priority: P1) [Dev Workflow]

As a developer, I need all my commits to be automatically scanned for accidentally included secrets so that credentials never reach the repository and become difficult to remove.

**Why this priority**: Credentials committed to git history are extremely difficult to remove and pose ongoing security risks even after deletion. Prevention is far more effective than remediation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to commit a file containing a known secret pattern (e.g., AWS key format) and verifying the commit is blocked with a clear error.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I accidentally add an API key to code, **When** I attempt to commit, **Then** the commit is blocked with a clear error showing the detected secret location
2. **Given** a file contains credentials in a known secret format, **When** I run git add, **Then** the secret is detected before it reaches the repository
3. **Given** a false positive is detected, **When** I review the detection, **Then** I can add it to an allowlist to prevent future false alarms
4. **Given** I am a new developer setting up the project, **When** I run the package install command, **Then** the pre-commit hook is automatically installed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an attacker submits data with prototype pollution patterns?
  - System detects dangerous keys and rejects the entire request with a validation error

- What happens when two users create payments at the exact same time?
  - Each payment is independently associated with the correct user via database-level enforcement

- What happens when the email validation service is down during sign-up?
  - System shows immediate error, preserves entered data, allows retry without re-entering information

- What happens when the same event notification is received multiple times?
  - Idempotency ensures the event is processed only once; duplicates are safely ignored

- What happens when a user's session expires mid-payment?
  - Payment state is preserved, user is prompted to sign in, payment resumes after re-authentication

- What happens when all retry attempts for a background process fail?
  - Administrators are notified via email and database flag; manual retry option available

- What happens when the pre-commit hook detects a legitimate-looking but intentional test credential?
  - Developer can add the specific pattern or file to the allowlist; the allowlist is version-controlled

- What happens when a developer bypasses the pre-commit hook locally?
  - CI pipeline runs the same secret scan as a backup gate and blocks the merge
