## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Automated Rebranding (Priority: P0)

As a developer, I need to transform a forked template into my own branded project with a single command so that I can start building immediately instead of spending hours on manual find-and-replace operations.

**Why this priority**: This is the core pain point - manual updates across 200+ files is the primary barrier to template adoption. Automating this delivers immediate, measurable value and is the fundamental value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by forking the repository, running the rebrand automation with custom project details, and verifying the application builds and runs with the new identity throughout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh fork of the template, **When** user runs the rebrand automation with project name, owner, and description, **Then** all references to the original project are replaced with the new identity
2. **Given** the rebrand automation has run, **When** user builds the project, **Then** the build succeeds with zero errors
3. **Given** files named with the original project name, **When** rebrand runs, **Then** files are renamed to use the new project name
4. **Given** the rebrand automation runs, **When** user checks deployment configuration files, **Then** original deployment settings have been cleared or updated

---

### User Story 2 - Tests Pass Without External Services (Priority: P0)

As a developer, I need to run the test suite immediately after forking before configuring any external services so that I can verify the codebase works and begin development with confidence.

**Why this priority**: Tests failing immediately after fork creates a poor first impression and blocks continuous integration setup. This is the second-biggest friction point after manual rebranding.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by removing all external service credentials and running the test suite - all tests should pass using comprehensive mocks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh fork with no external service configuration, **When** user runs the test suite, **Then** all unit tests pass using mocked service clients
2. **Given** tests that interact with authentication, database, or realtime features, **When** they execute, **Then** they receive comprehensive mock implementations
3. **Given** tests that validate project metadata, **When** they run after rebranding, **Then** they use generic assertions that don't depend on specific text content

---

### User Story 3 - Deployment Works Automatically (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need my fork to deploy correctly to static hosting without manual path configuration so that the site works immediately when I enable deployment.

**Why this priority**: Broken deployments (white screen, missing assets) make the template appear broken and erode trust in the template quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling static hosting deployment and verifying the deployed site loads correctly with all assets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fork without custom base path configuration, **When** deployment runs, **Then** the base path is auto-detected from the repository name
2. **Given** deployment workflow runs, **When** checking for base path configuration, **Then** empty values are treated as "auto-detect" rather than "empty string"
3. **Given** the auto-detection process, **When** it runs in the deployment environment, **Then** it correctly derives the deployment path for forked repositories

---

### User Story 4 - Development Environment Git Workflow (Priority: P1)

As a developer working in a containerized development environment, I need to commit changes without errors or warnings so that my normal git workflow is uninterrupted.

**Why this priority**: Git workflow friction affects daily development productivity but has documented workarounds.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making a change in the development container and committing it successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the development container, **When** it starts, **Then** git directory permissions are configured correctly
2. **Given** documentation, **When** developer reads commit instructions, **Then** they understand the recommended workflow
3. **Given** environment configuration examples, **When** developer sets them up, **Then** git author information is correctly configured

---

### User Story 5 - Graceful Degradation Without Services (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need the application to display helpful guidance instead of crashing when external services aren't configured so that I can understand what setup is required.

**Why this priority**: While external services are required for full functionality, graceful degradation with clear setup guidance improves the onboarding experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the application without external service configuration and verifying it loads with setup instructions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** missing external service configuration in production, **When** application loads, **Then** it displays a dismissible guidance banner with setup instructions
2. **Given** the service client initialization, **When** configuration is missing, **Then** it returns a safe placeholder or deferred initialization
3. **Given** the guidance banner is displayed, **When** user dismisses it, **Then** banner does not reappear until the next session

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user runs rebrand automation twice with different names?
  - System detects previously rebranded state and prompts for confirmation before proceeding

- How does rebrand handle special characters in project name?
  - System auto-sanitizes input (spaces to hyphens, removes special characters)

- What if user has uncommitted changes when running rebrand?
  - System warns about uncommitted changes but proceeds (non-blocking)

- How does the automation handle case-sensitivity (MyApp vs myapp vs MYAPP)?
  - Preserves user's casing for display name, derives lowercase for technical identifiers

- What if the fork was renamed remotely but not locally?
  - System updates local remote configuration automatically

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

**Rebrand Automation**

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept project name, owner, and description as inputs
- **FR-002**: System MUST replace all case variations of the original project name with the new name
- **FR-003**: System MUST rename files containing the original project name in their filenames
- **FR-004**: System MUST update container/service configuration with the new project name
- **FR-005**: System MUST clear deployment-specific configurations unless user opts to keep them
