## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - First Visit Consent (Priority: P0)

As a first-time visitor, I need to be informed about cookie usage and make a choice before any non-essential cookies are set so that my privacy preferences are respected from the start.

**Why this priority**: Legal requirement for GDPR compliance. Without this, the application cannot legally operate in the EU. This is the constitutional requirement (Section 4: Privacy-First).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the application in a fresh browser session and verifying the consent modal appears before any tracking occurs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the application for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** a consent modal appears before any non-essential cookies are set
2. **Given** the consent modal is displayed, **When** user clicks "Accept All", **Then** all cookie categories are enabled and the modal closes
3. **Given** the consent modal is displayed, **When** user clicks "Reject All", **Then** only necessary cookies remain enabled and the modal closes
4. **Given** the consent modal is displayed, **When** user clicks "Manage Preferences", **Then** they see granular controls for each cookie category

---

### User Story 2 - Granular Cookie Control (Priority: P0)

As a privacy-conscious user, I need to control exactly which types of cookies are used so that I can allow functional features while blocking tracking.

**Why this priority**: Core GDPR requirement - users must have granular control over consent categories. Necessary for legal compliance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening cookie preferences, toggling individual categories, saving, and verifying only allowed cookies are active.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the preferences panel is open, **When** user views cookie categories, **Then** they see four distinct categories: Necessary (always on), Functional, Analytics, and Marketing
2. **Given** a cookie category toggle, **When** user enables/disables it, **Then** the change is reflected immediately in the UI
3. **Given** user has made preference selections, **When** they save preferences, **Then** the settings persist across sessions
4. **Given** Necessary cookies category, **When** user attempts to disable it, **Then** the toggle is disabled with explanation that these are required

---

### User Story 3 - Preference Persistence (Priority: P1)

As a returning user, I need my cookie preferences to be remembered so that I don't have to re-configure them on every visit.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user experience - without persistence, users would face the consent modal on every visit, which is frustrating and non-compliant.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting preferences, closing browser, returning, and verifying preferences are maintained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has previously set cookie preferences, **When** they return to the application, **Then** the consent modal does not appear
2. **Given** stored preferences exist, **When** the application loads, **Then** cookie behavior matches the saved preferences
3. **Given** stored preferences from an older version, **When** the consent policy is updated, **Then** user is prompted to re-consent

---

### User Story 4 - Update Preferences Anytime (Priority: P1)

As a user who changed my mind about tracking, I need to access and modify my cookie preferences at any time so that I maintain control over my privacy.

**Why this priority**: GDPR requires that consent be as easy to withdraw as it is to give. Users must have ongoing access to their preferences.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to privacy settings, changing preferences, and verifying the changes take effect immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has previously consented, **When** they navigate to privacy settings, **Then** they see their current consent status for each category
2. **Given** the privacy settings page, **When** user modifies their preferences and saves, **Then** the changes take effect immediately
3. **Given** the application footer or settings menu, **When** user looks for privacy controls, **Then** they find a clearly labeled link to manage cookie preferences

---

### User Story 5 - Data Export (Priority: P2)

As a user exercising my GDPR rights, I need to export all data the application has stored about me so that I can see exactly what information has been collected.

**Why this priority**: GDPR "Right of Access" requirement. Important for compliance but less frequently used than consent management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting data export and verifying the download contains all locally stored data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the privacy controls page, **When** user requests data export, **Then** they receive a downloadable file containing all their data
2. **Given** the export file, **When** user opens it, **Then** it contains consent history, stored preferences, and any locally persisted data
3. **Given** the export process, **When** it completes, **Then** it finishes within 5 seconds for typical data volumes

---

### User Story 6 - Data Deletion Request (Priority: P2)

As a user exercising my GDPR rights, I need to request deletion of my data so that I can exercise my "right to be forgotten."

**Why this priority**: GDPR "Right to Erasure" requirement. Can be handled through a request form for static applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a deletion request and verifying local data is cleared and request is logged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the privacy controls page, **When** user requests data deletion, **Then** they see a confirmation dialog explaining what will be deleted
2. **Given** confirmation is provided, **When** deletion proceeds, **Then** all locally stored data is removed
3. **Given** the deletion is complete, **When** user views the application, **Then** they are treated as a first-time visitor

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has an adblocker that interferes with the consent system?
  - Consent modal still appears; system uses fallback detection methods

- How does the system behave if local storage is disabled or full?
  - System displays a warning and operates in "necessary cookies only" mode

- What happens when consent version changes after user already consented?
  - User is shown the consent modal again with explanation of what changed

- How does the system handle users who dismiss the modal without making a choice?
  - Modal remains or reappears; no non-essential cookies are set until explicit consent

- What if a third-party script loads cookies before consent is given?
  - Scripts are blocked until consent; only necessary first-party functionality operates
