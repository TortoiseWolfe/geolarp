## Overview

Comprehensive mobile-first responsive design overhaul ensuring the site provides a clean, native-feeling mobile experience where all content is readable, all controls are tappable, and nothing requires horizontal scrolling or zooming.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Viewport-Safe Navigation (Priority: P1)

A mobile user visits any page on their phone and expects the navigation header to fit within the viewport without any horizontal scrolling, with all controls visible and tappable.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is the primary interaction point - if users can't navigate, they can't use the site at all.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading any page at 320px width and verifying no horizontal scroll exists and all nav controls are accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage on a 320px wide device (iPhone SE), **When** they view the page, **Then** the navigation header fits within the viewport with no horizontal scroll and all interactive elements are tappable
2. **Given** a user on a 320px device, **When** navigation controls don't fit at full size, **Then** all control buttons shrink proportionally to fit (no controls are hidden)
3. **Given** a user taps navigation controls, **When** they interact with buttons, **Then** all touch targets are at least 44x44px with minimum 8px spacing

---

### User Story 2 - Readable Content (Priority: P1)

A mobile user reading blog posts or other content can comfortably read text without zooming, with code blocks contained and images fitting within the viewport.

**Why this priority**: Content consumption is the core value proposition - unreadable content defeats the site's purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading a blog post with code blocks and images at 390px width, verifying readability and containment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is reading a blog post on a 390px wide device (iPhone 12), **When** they scroll through the content, **Then** text is comfortably readable without zooming (minimum 16px font size)
2. **Given** a page contains code blocks, **When** code exceeds viewport width, **Then** code blocks scroll internally (overflow-x: auto) without causing page-wide horizontal scroll
3. **Given** a page contains images, **When** images are displayed, **Then** images fit within the mobile viewport using responsive srcset

---

### User Story 3 - Touch-Friendly Interactions (Priority: P2)

A mobile user can accurately tap on all interactive elements without accidentally hitting adjacent controls, with no reliance on hover states.

**Why this priority**: Accurate touch interaction is essential for usability but builds on having visible, navigable content first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring all interactive elements and verifying 44x44px minimum with 8px spacing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user taps on interactive elements, **When** they interact with buttons, links, or controls, **Then** all touch targets are at least 44x44px (Apple HIG standard)
2. **Given** interactive elements are adjacent, **When** user views the interface, **Then** minimum 8px spacing exists between tappable controls
3. **Given** a desktop feature uses hover states, **When** viewed on mobile, **Then** essential interactions are accessible without hover (mobile has no hover)

---

### User Story 4 - Consistent Mobile Experience (Priority: P2)

A mobile user experiences purpose-built mobile layouts across all pages, not scaled-down desktop versions, with consistent behavior across device orientations.

**Why this priority**: Design consistency reinforces trust and usability but requires foundational elements to be in place first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing mobile layouts against desktop to verify distinct, purpose-built mobile designs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views any page at mobile width (320px-428px), **When** they load the page, **Then** there is zero horizontal scroll across the entire page
2. **Given** a mobile user views the site compared to desktop, **When** observing the layouts, **Then** mobile layouts are purpose-built for mobile (not just scaled-down desktop)
3. **Given** a user rotates their device to landscape (e.g., iPhone 12 at 844x390), **When** orientation changes, **Then** mobile styles and breakpoints are maintained (physical device type determines UI mode)

---

### User Story 5 - Performance on Mobile Networks (Priority: P3)

A mobile user on 3G/4G networks experiences fast page loads with minimal layout shift during loading.

**Why this priority**: Performance optimization enhances experience but is less critical than basic functionality and usability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested using Lighthouse mobile audit to verify LCP, FID, and CLS metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user loads a page on mobile, **When** the page renders, **Then** Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is under 2.5 seconds
2. **Given** a user interacts with the page, **When** they tap an element, **Then** First Input Delay (FID) is under 100ms
3. **Given** a page is loading, **When** content renders progressively, **Then** Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is below 0.1

---

### Edge Cases

**Narrow Devices (320px)**:

- Navigation buttons shrink proportionally to fit all controls within viewport
- All controls remain visible (no hiding in hamburger menu)
- Font sizes capped at "large" maximum (x-large disabled) to prevent layout breaks

**Very Long Content**:

- Code blocks scroll internally with overflow-x: auto
- Page maintains zero horizontal scroll regardless of code block width

**Touch Target Conflicts**:

- Minimum 44x44px touch targets maintained through button sizing
- Minimum 8px spacing between controls preserved even when shrunk

**Orientation Changes**:

- Landscape mobile orientation uses mobile breakpoints and styles
- Physical device type determines UI mode, not just viewport width
- Example: iPhone 12 rotated to 844x390 landscape stays in mobile mode

**User Zoom**:

- Layouts support user zoom up to 200% without breaking
- Text remains readable at all zoom levels

**Image Loading Failures**:

- Failed images display styled placeholder with visible alt text and retry button (default)
- Image error handling implemented in single swappable component for fork customization
- Alternative behaviors (LQIP blur-up, hide) documented for template forks

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-30

- Q: How should heading sizes scale for mobile? → A: Percentage reduction from desktop (60-75% of desktop sizes), maintaining visual hierarchy
- Q: What defines "efficient" loading on mobile networks? → A: TTI under 5 seconds on 3G AND total page weight under 1MB (critical content under 500KB)
- Q: What happens when images fail to load? → A: Default to styled placeholder with alt text + retry button; implemented in single swappable component with documentation for alternative behaviors (LQIP blur-up, hide, etc.)

---

## Assumptions

- Users primarily access on iOS devices (iPhone SE through iPhone 14 Pro Max)
- 320px is the minimum viable mobile width; narrower devices are not explicitly supported
- Landscape orientation on mobile devices should maintain mobile UI (not switch to tablet)
- Modern image formats (WebP/AVIF) are acceptable with fallbacks for older browsers
