| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| X-01, X-02, X-03 | FALSE POSITIVE: Current SVG has properly quoted attributes. Validator data may be stale.    | CLOSE - re-run validator |
| A-01             | FALSE POSITIVE: SVG has 4 callouts on desktop (lines 76-97) and 4 on mobile (lines 140-162) | CLOSE - re-run validator |
| U-01             | FALSE POSITIVE: Annotation panel has US-001, US-002, US-003, US-004 (4 unique user stories) | CLOSE - re-run validator |
| M-01             | FALSE POSITIVE: Mobile content starts at y=86 (line 108), which is >= 78 safe area          | CLOSE - re-run validator |
| title_x_position | Title at x=700 instead of x=960 - confirmed WRONG                                           | REGENERATE               |

**Positive Observations:**

- Proper desktop/mobile layout with standard dimensions
- 4 callouts properly numbered on both mockups
- Navigation active state shown (Features tab highlighted purple #8b5cf6)
- Code block with internal scroll indicator demonstrated
- Responsive image with srcset explanation (320w, 640w, 1280w)
- Good annotation panel with 4 groups covering US-001 through US-004
- Key concepts row at bottom summarizing touch target standards

**Validator False Positives:**
The validator appears to be reporting issues from a previous version of this SVG. Re-running the validator should clear these false positives. The current SVG structure is valid.

**Overall Assessment:** Good wireframe demonstrating mobile-first navigation principles. Only issue is title positioning - needs regeneration to change x=700 to x=960.
