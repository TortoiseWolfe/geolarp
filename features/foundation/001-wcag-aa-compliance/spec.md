# Feature Specification: WCAG AAA Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `001-wcag-aaa-compliance`
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Status**: Partial
**Input**: User description: "Automated WCAG AAA compliance system - the highest accessibility standard - with testing, real-time feedback, and remediation guidance."

<!-- AUDIT-IMPL-STATUS-BEGIN -->

## Implementation Status

**Last audited**: 2026-05-06 (#21 Phase 0 closure)
**Real status**: Mostly shipped (AAA contrast bumped; live overlay deferred)
**Tracking**: #21 closing PR + #80 (live overlay follow-up)

### Shipped

- pa11y + axe-core integration
- \*.accessibility.test.tsx files across components
- ContactForm a11y suite green (3255+/3255+ pass)
- **AAA contrast scope** — `config/pa11yci.json` standard is `WCAG2AAA`;
  `tests/e2e/color-contrast.spec.ts` uses the `color-contrast-enhanced`
  axe rule (7:1 normal text / 4.5:1 large text)
- Contrast gate split: pa11y covers non-contrast AAA criteria
  (focus visibility, link purpose, etc.); E2E spec covers contrast
  (because pa11y treats axe `incomplete` as failure, which produces
  14–61 false positives per page on DaisyUI `.btn` gradients)

### Deferred

- Live a11y overlay (dev-time floating panel): tracked in #80,
  deferred to v0.1.0+ per the original next-session primer

### Notes

- Spec was originally written at AAA scope; the code had drifted to AA.
  #21 aligned the code to the spec rather than the inverse — the
  template ships at the level the spec promises. Per memory rule
  "always prefer cleaner long-term solutions over quick short-term
  hacks," amending the spec down to AA was rejected.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Zero Critical Violations in CI (Priority: P0)

As a developer, I need the CI/CD pipeline to automatically block deployments with accessibility violations so that we never ship inaccessible code to production.

**Why this priority**: Preventing regressions is the most critical function. Without CI enforcement, accessibility improvements erode over time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by introducing an intentional violation (missing alt text) and verifying the build fails.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request with accessibility violations, **When** CI runs, **Then** the build fails with clear error messages
2. **Given** all pages pass accessibility tests, **When** CI runs, **Then** the build succeeds
3. **Given** a violation is detected, **When** viewing the CI output, **Then** the specific element, issue, and remediation are displayed
4. **Given** CI completes, **When** results are available, **Then** they are stored for historical tracking

### User Story 2 - AAA-Level Contrast Compliance (Priority: P0)

As a user with low vision, I need all text to meet the 7:1 contrast ratio so that I can read content without strain or assistive tools.

**Why this priority**: WCAG AAA requires 7:1 contrast for normal text (vs 4.5:1 for AA). This is the defining difference of AAA compliance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring contrast ratios across all themes and verifying minimum 7:1 for text, 4.5:1 for large text.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any text element on any page, **When** contrast is measured, **Then** normal text meets 7:1 ratio minimum
2. **Given** large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold), **When** contrast is measured, **Then** it meets 4.5:1 ratio minimum
3. **Given** the application's theme options, **When** any theme is applied, **Then** all themes meet AAA contrast requirements
4. **Given** interactive elements (links, buttons), **When** in any state (hover, focus, active), **Then** contrast requirements are maintained

---

### User Story 3 - Keyboard-Only Navigation (Priority: P0)

As a user who cannot use a mouse, I need to navigate and operate all functionality using only a keyboard so that I have equal access to all features.

**Why this priority**: Keyboard accessibility is fundamental to WCAG and enables access for motor impairments, screen reader users, and power users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by unplugging the mouse and completing all primary tasks using only keyboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any page in the application, **When** user presses Tab, **Then** focus moves logically through all interactive elements
2. **Given** a focused interactive element, **When** user presses Enter or Space, **Then** the element activates appropriately
3. **Given** a modal or dropdown is open, **When** user presses Escape, **Then** it closes and focus returns to trigger
4. **Given** focus is on any element, **When** visible, **Then** focus indicator has minimum 2px outline or equivalent visibility
5. **Given** a complex widget (menu, tabs, accordion), **When** navigating, **Then** arrow keys work as expected per ARIA patterns

---

### User Story 4 - Touch Target Sizing (Priority: P1)

As a user with motor impairments, I need all interactive elements to be at least 44×44 pixels so that I can accurately tap or click them.

**Why this priority**: WCAG AAA requires minimum 44×44 CSS pixel touch targets. This benefits users with tremors, limited dexterity, or using touch devices.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring all buttons, links, and interactive elements to verify minimum dimensions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any button in the application, **When** dimensions are measured, **Then** it is at least 44×44 CSS pixels
2. **Given** a text link, **When** rendered, **Then** the clickable area is at least 44×44 CSS pixels (with padding if needed)
3. **Given** form controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, inputs), **When** rendered, **Then** the interactive area meets minimum size
4. **Given** close buttons or small icons, **When** rendered, **Then** they include sufficient padding for 44×44 target area

---

### User Story 5 - Screen Reader Compatibility (Priority: P1)

As a blind user relying on a screen reader, I need all content to be announced correctly so that I can understand and interact with the application.

**Why this priority**: Screen reader users depend on proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for navigation and comprehension.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating the application with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver and verifying all content is announced.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any image, **When** screen reader encounters it, **Then** alt text is announced (or marked decorative)
2. **Given** form fields, **When** screen reader focuses them, **Then** label and any error/help text are announced
3. **Given** dynamic content updates, **When** they occur, **Then** appropriate ARIA live regions announce changes
4. **Given** navigation landmarks, **When** screen reader lists them, **Then** main, nav, header, footer are properly identified
5. **Given** custom components (modals, tabs, accordions), **When** used, **Then** ARIA roles and states are correctly applied

---

### User Story 6 - No Time Limits (Priority: P1)

As a user who needs extra time to read or complete tasks, I need no time-based restrictions so that I can work at my own pace.

**Why this priority**: WCAG AAA requires eliminating time limits entirely (AA allows extensions). This supports cognitive disabilities and slower readers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by leaving sessions idle and verifying no automatic timeouts, logouts, or content changes occur.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any form or multi-step process, **When** user takes unlimited time, **Then** no timeout occurs
2. **Given** session management, **When** user is inactive, **Then** session persists without automatic logout
3. **Given** any auto-updating content, **When** it would update, **Then** user can pause, stop, or control the update
4. **Given** animated content, **When** displayed, **Then** user can pause all movement

---

### User Story 7 - Reading Level Optimization (Priority: P2)

As a user with cognitive disabilities or limited literacy, I need content written at a lower secondary education reading level so that I can understand it.

**Why this priority**: WCAG AAA requires content readable at approximately 7th-9th grade level. This includes clear language, short sentences, and explained terminology.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running content through readability analyzers and verifying Flesch-Kincaid grade level ≤ 9.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any user-facing text, **When** analyzed, **Then** it scores at lower secondary education reading level
2. **Given** technical terms or jargon, **When** used, **Then** they are defined or explained in context
3. **Given** instructions or error messages, **When** read, **Then** they use simple, direct language
4. **Given** abbreviations, **When** first used, **Then** the full term is provided

---

### User Story 8 - Real-time Development Feedback (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need real-time accessibility feedback during development so that I can fix issues immediately rather than discovering them in CI.

**Why this priority**: Shifting accessibility left (earlier in development) reduces remediation cost and improves developer awareness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting the dev server with accessibility watcher and verifying console warnings appear for violations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** development mode is active, **When** an accessibility violation exists, **Then** console warning appears with details
2. **Given** component development in Storybook, **When** viewing any story, **Then** accessibility panel shows violations
3. **Given** a file is saved with violations, **When** watcher detects it, **Then** terminal shows updated accessibility status
4. **Given** any violation warning, **When** displayed, **Then** it includes the specific element and remediation guidance

---

### User Story 9 - Accessibility Dashboard (Priority: P2)

As a project stakeholder, I need a dashboard showing accessibility compliance status so that I can monitor progress and identify problem areas.

**Why this priority**: Visibility into compliance status enables informed prioritization and demonstrates commitment to accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the dashboard and verifying it displays current scores, trends, and specific issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the accessibility dashboard, **When** loaded, **Then** overall compliance score is displayed
2. **Given** per-page breakdown, **When** viewing, **Then** each page shows its score and issue count
3. **Given** historical data, **When** viewing trends, **Then** compliance changes over time are visible
4. **Given** specific issues, **When** drilling down, **Then** exact elements and remediation steps are shown

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a third-party component fails accessibility tests?
  - Document known issues, implement wrapper with ARIA fixes where possible, or replace component

- How are dynamically loaded components (lazy loading, modals) tested?
  - Test suite includes scenarios that trigger dynamic content loading before running accessibility checks

- What if a theme fails contrast requirements?
  - Theme is flagged in CI and excluded from production until fixed; fallback to compliant default

- How are complex data visualizations (charts, graphs) made accessible?
  - Provide text alternatives, data tables, and ARIA labels; complex visualizations include accessible summaries

- What if accessibility requirements conflict with design specifications?
  - Accessibility requirements take precedence; escalate to design team for AAA-compliant alternatives
