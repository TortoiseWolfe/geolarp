// geoLARP Service Worker v1.0.0
// Provides offline support, caching, and background sync
// Note: Cache name includes project name - updated by rebrand script

// Stamped at build time by scripts/stamp-sw-version.mjs, which rewrites this
// literal in `out/sw.js` after `next build` (#317). The value here is the dev
// default and is intentionally left in the tracked source.
//
// It previously read "Updated by scripts/rebrand.sh", which was never true —
// rebrand.sh does not mention sw.js — so this string never changed. Returning
// visitors therefore kept a frozen precache forever, which is what turned a
// trailing-slash cache miss into a permanent offline page rather than a
// one-deploy blip.
//
// MUST keep the `geolarp-` prefix: the activate handler purges old caches
// by matching that prefix, so a different one would leak storage instead of
// cleaning up.

// (#438).
//
// This used to be `${CACHE_VERSION}-images`. Because CACHE_VERSION is stamped
// with the commit SHA, every deploy renamed it and `activate` deleted the
// previous one — throwing away every cached image on a code change that had
// nothing to do with images. Combined with `skipWaiting()` + `clients.claim()`
// below, an open page had its image cache deleted mid-session and was then
// claimed by the new worker, so its not-yet-requested lazy images all faulted
// into an empty cache at once. Reported from the live blog as broken-image
// icons on exactly the below-the-fold cards, with the already-painted ones
// above them fine.
//
// A fresh browser CANNOT reproduce that — with no previous worker there is no
// takeover and no deletion — which is why a clean-profile check reported 14 of
// 14 images loaded while real visitors saw them break.
//
// Bump this by hand only when the image CACHING BEHAVIOUR changes; a content
// change does not need it, since entries are keyed by request URL. Keeps the
// `geolarp-` prefix so the activate purge below still owns it rather than
// leaking it.

/**
 * Find a cached page for a navigation request, tolerating the trailing-slash
 * mismatch between what gets precached and what users actually navigate to.
 *
 * ## The bug this fixes (#317)
 * STATIC_ASSETS precaches directory-style paths WITH a trailing slash
 * (`'./blog/'`), because that is how the static export names them. Users and
 * links navigate to `/blog` WITHOUT one. The server papers over this with a
 * 301, but a cache lookup is exact: `caches.match('/blog')` misses a cache
 * holding `/blog/`.
 *
 * So a single momentary network failure — the fallback path is only reached
 * when `fetch()` rejects — turned into a full "You're Offline" page on every
 * non-home route, while the homepage (`'./'`, which needs no toggling) kept
 * working. That asymmetry is what made it look like a site outage rather than
 * a cache-key bug.
 *
 * Order matters: exact first, so a page cached under the exact URL is never
 * shadowed by a variant.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when every variant misses, which is the caller's signal
 * to serve offline.html — genuinely uncached routes must still get it.
