/**
 * Deployed-config validity guard (#288).
 *
 * `scripts/supabase/auth-config.json` is the checked-in desired state for the
 * Supabase auth config (site_url, uri_allow_list, …), applied to the project via
 * `pnpm supabase:auth-config --apply`. #287 shipped a prod where `site_url` was
 * `http://localhost:3000` and `uri_allow_list` was empty — so OAuth/email
 * redirects broke and no human could complete sign-up, while every test stayed
 * green. This test pins the *validity* of the desired state so a localhost /
 * empty regression can't be committed unnoticed.
 *
 * (Whether the LIVE project matches this file is a separate drift check —
 * `pnpm supabase:auth-config:check` — which needs the Management API token and
 * runs in CI once that secret is configured.)
 *
 * @module tests/unit/auth-config-validity.test

   *
   * `oauth-csrf.spec.ts` is the only thing that has ever asserted prod's OAuth client ids
   * are real rather than placeholders, and it does so from a browser against the HOSTED
   * project. The CI plan moves it to a weekly `@hosted` lane so PRs can run against a local
   * Supabase — which would delete that coverage, because `set-auth-config.ts` compares only
   * `Object.keys(desired)` and this file carried NO `external_*` keys at all.
   *
   * So the ids move into the desired state (they are public — every authorize URL carries
   * them), the daily drift gate starts covering them, and these cases stop a placeholder
   * being committed here in the first place. The shapes deliberately match
   * `tests/e2e/utils/oauth-validity.ts`, so the local guard and the browser guard cannot
   * drift apart in what they consider a real id.
