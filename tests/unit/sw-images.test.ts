/**
 * Unit tests for the service worker's IMAGE handler (#438).
 *
 * ## Why these exist
 * Returning visitors lost blog images on every deploy. Four below-the-fold
 * thumbnails rendered as broken-image icons with their alt text showing, while
 * the already-painted cards above them were fine.
 *
 * Three things combined. `install` calls `skipWaiting()`, `activate` deleted
 * every cache whose name did not match the current `CACHE_VERSION` — which is
 * stamped with the commit SHA, so a code deploy destroyed the IMAGE cache —
 * and `activate` then calls `clients.claim()` on the page that is already open.
 * The page's not-yet-requested lazy images therefore faulted into an empty
 * cache all at once, and the image handler was the ONLY content handler with
 * no failure path, so a rejected fetch became a permanent broken image with no
 * retry and nothing cached.
 *
 * ## The trap these tests are shaped around
 * A fresh browser CANNOT reproduce this. With no previous worker there is no
 * takeover, no deletion, and no empty-cache window — a clean-profile check of
 * the live site reported 14 of 14 images loaded while real visitors saw them
 * break. Any test that exercises one version against a healthy network passes
 * straight through the bug.
 *
 * So these assert the two properties that actually failed: the handler must not
 * REJECT when the network does, and the image cache must not be keyed to the
 * build.
 *
 * Runs the REAL `public/sw.js` through the same `new Function` harness as
 * sw-navigate.test.ts — a reimplementation would drift and prove nothing.
 *
 * @module tests/unit/sw-images.test
