/**
 * Guards that a shipped blog image actually contains an image (#439).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * `public/blog-images/admin-dashboard-overview/overview.png` — the thumbnail
 * for "Building a Centralized Admin Dashboard" — shipped to the live blog as a
 * blank white box. It was a valid PNG of the right dimensions that served 200,
 * so every existing check was satisfied. Its CONTENT was gone: 89.1% pure white
 * across 69 distinct colours, down from a real dark-theme screenshot.
 *
 * It was destroyed by commit 9352890, "compressed overview image", which took
 * the file from 54,840 bytes to 5,968. Nothing verified the result, so a blank
 * rectangle sat on the blog from 2026-03-03.
 *
 * ## Why the obvious guard is the WRONG one
 * The first instinct is to reject an image whose dominant colour dominates —
 * "89% white means blank". Measured across every raster image this repo ships,
 * that rule fails badly:
 *
 *     sortable.png   98.5% one colour   FINE (dark-theme screenshot)
 *     users.png      96.9%              FINE
 *     audit.png      96.3%              FINE
 *     overview.png   94.4%              FINE — this is the RESTORED good file
 *
 * A dark UI screenshot is legitimately almost all background. The threshold
 * would have rejected the very image it was meant to protect.
 *
 * ## The signal that does discriminate
 * Distinct colour count. Detail survives compression as colour variety; a
 * blanked image loses it:
 *
 *     broken overview.png       69 colours
 *     restored overview.png    606
 *     lowest legitimate image  254  (bad-seo-example-og.png)
 *
 * The floor below sits between 69 and 254 with margin on both sides. It is set
 * from measurement, not taste — and it is verified to reject the broken file,
 * which is the only thing that makes it a guard rather than decoration.
 *
 * NOTE (#28): every file named above — overview/sortable/users/audit.png and
 * bad-seo-example-og.png — belonged to the template's own posts and was removed
 * when this fork stopped republishing them. The measurements stand as the record
 * of how MIN_DISTINCT_COLOURS was chosen; the files are simply no longer here to
 * re-measure. Re-derive the threshold from the current corpus before changing it.
