/**
 * No production build may run inside the dev-server container (#293, #508).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `next dev` and `next build` both own `/app/.next`. A build launched with
 * `docker compose exec <dev-service> pnpm build` writes into the directory the
 * dev server is serving from, and the two race during "Collecting page data":
 *
 *     unhandledRejection Error: Cannot find module './6048.js'
 *
 * Exit 1, no test output — indistinguishable in a log from a real build break,
 * so every occurrence costs a diagnosis and a rebuild. It happened **six times
 * across 2026-08-02 and 08-03**, three of them killing acceptance runs
 * mid-session, and one of them corrupting the dev server so quietly that `/`
 * served 200 while `/contact` served 500 — which a route-sweeping a11y probe
 * then filed as fifteen missing `<main>` landmarks (#475).
 *
 * The fix is structural: the `builder` service is the same image with its own
 * `.next` volume and no dev server inside it, so there is nothing to race.
 *
 *     docker compose run --rm builder pnpm build     # correct
 *     docker compose exec geolarp pnpm build    # the defect
 *
 * ## Why a test and not a comment
 *
 * #293 fixed the call sites it knew about and wrote the rule into CLAUDE.md and
 * `docker-compose.yml`. **Three more survived anyway** — `e2e-live-acceptance.sh`
 * (isolated by `NEXT_DIST_DIR`, which turned out not to be enough),
 * `package.json`'s `test:pwa:build` (not isolated at all), and `rebrand.sh`,
 * which printed the offending command to every fork as step 2 of its own
 * instructions. Prose does not fail a build. This does, in `Test (20.x)`, which
 * is a required check.
 *
 * ## Documentation is scanned too, but only where it INSTRUCTS (#835)
 *
 * The scan above deliberately skips `docs/`, because prose describing this
 * anti-pattern is documentation of it rather than an instance. That reasoning is
 * right and is kept — but it left a second hole: prose that TELLS a reader to run
 * the command is an instance, and 13 of them survived across five live documents.
 * One was **serving in production** (`public/blog/auto-configuration-system.md`,
 * `featured: true`), so a visitor following our own onboarding post broke their dev
 * server. `docs/FORKING.md` had it twice using the FORKER's service name
 * (`exec myproject`), which is why greps for `exec geolarp` never found it.
 *
 * So documents are scanned with the SAME regexes and two extra exclusions: a line
 * that negates the command is a description, and archived spec directories are
 * history rather than guidance.
 *
