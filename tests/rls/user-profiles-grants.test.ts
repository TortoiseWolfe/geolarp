/**
 * `user_profiles` must not expose or accept `is_admin` from a browser (#38).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GRANTS TEST AND NOT AN RLS TEST. RLS restricts ROWS. It has
 * nothing to say about COLUMNS, and this table's read policy is
 * `USING (true)` for `authenticated` by design, so friend search works. The
 * only thing standing between a signed-in stranger and every column of every
 * row is the GRANT — and the grant that used to be here read
 * `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON user_profiles TO authenticated`, which
 * narrowed nothing: Supabase's platform defaults hand both `anon` and
 * `authenticated` ALL privileges on every table in `public`, so the file's
 * narrower grant sat on top of a wider one. Measured on production before the
 * fix, both roles held DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, TRIGGER, TRUNCATE
 * and UPDATE on all nine columns. Same trap as #897 on `payment_intents`.
 *
 * WHAT WAS EXPLOITABLE, and why this is more than disclosure. The update policy
 * allows `auth.uid() = id`, the grant covered every column, and no trigger
 * guards the flag, so any signed-in user could run
 *
 *   UPDATE user_profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id = auth.uid();
 *
 * while `is_admin()` reads that column live as the single authority for every
 * admin RPC and policy. Confirmed refused against production after the fix,
 * with `42501 permission denied`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated so a green run is not over-read: it runs against
 * the LOCAL stack, so it pins what a FRESH database gets from the migration. It
 * cannot see production drift — that needs a scheduled probe in the shape of
 * `auth-config-drift.yml`. Production was NOT fine, and this test would have
 * been green throughout.
