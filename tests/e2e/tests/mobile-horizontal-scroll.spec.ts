/**
 * Horizontal Scroll Detection Test
 * PRP-017: Mobile-First Design Overhaul
 * Task: T010
 *
 * #373 §B1 — THIS GATE COULD NOT FAIL.
 *
 * It swept `TEST_PAGES`: three routes, `/`, `/blog` and one blog post, at four
 * widths. 12 of its 16 assertions, and every one of those 12, checked
 * `documentElement.scrollWidth <= clientWidth`.
 *
 * Measured across all 42 routes at 320/375/390/428px on live production:
 *
 *   documentElement.scrollWidth overflow ... 0 routes
 *   real element overflow .................. 41 of 42 routes
 *
 * The document can never report horizontal overflow, because the layout frame
 * in `src/app/layout.tsx` clips the x axis — `overflow-x-clip` today, and
 * `overflow-hidden` before #373 §A4. So `scrollWidth` is pinned to
 * `clientWidth` by construction and the assertion is decoration. Meanwhile a
 * `btn-ghost btn-sm` in the cookie banner sat 11px past the right edge of a
 * 320px viewport on 41 routes, and 17 green checks per PR said nothing.
 *
 * Two changes:
 *
 * 1. ROUTES ARE ENUMERATED from `src/app/**\/page.tsx`, the same as
 *    `color-contrast.spec.ts` since #411. A new route is covered the day it is
 *    created; opting out is a visible entry with a reason, not an omission.
 * 2. The PRIMARY assertion is per-element geometry, which sees THROUGH the
 *    clip. `scrollWidth` is kept as a cheap second signal — it is not
 *    load-bearing, but if the frame ever stops clipping it will start working.
 *
 * WHY THE ELEMENT CHECK NEEDS EXCLUSIONS, and why they are not a way to make it
 * pass. Measured unfiltered, it flagged 39 of 42 routes and 1228 elements. They
 * fell into three kinds and only one is a defect:
 *
 *   - SCROLLED by an ancestor — DaisyUI puts `overflow-x: auto` on `.stats`, so
 *     a wide child is the design working. Content the user can reach by
 *     scrolling the element it lives in is the RECOMMENDED pattern.
 *   - a transform artefact — `getBoundingClientRect` includes transforms, so
 *     the home page's scale-animating logo reports overflow no layout has.
 *     Asserting on it would be flaky by construction.
 *   - everything else. That is the defect, and after filtering it was exactly
 *     one element per route.
 *
 * #506 — `hidden` AND `clip` USED TO EXCUSE TOO, AND THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE CASE.
 *
 * The excuse list was `['hidden', 'clip', 'auto', 'scroll']`, which collapses
 * two opposite outcomes. `auto`/`scroll` means the user can still REACH the
 * content. `hidden`/`clip` means it is GONE — and an ancestor clip is precisely
 * what stops overflow from producing the page scrollbar this file's secondary
 * assertion looks for, so excusing it made the gate blind wherever it mattered
 * most.
 *
 * Measured on a root build carrying Cloudflare's public test key, `/sign-in` at
 * 320px:
 *
 *     CaptchaWidget size    widget    elements past the viewport
 *     compact (shipped)     150x140    0
 *     normal  (pre-#488)    300x65    28
 *
 * All 28 were excused by an ancestor with `overflow-x: clip`, and NONE of them
 * was transform-excused. So on the exact defect #488 fixed, this gate reported
 * green — the "gate that cannot fail" pattern catalogued in #396.
 *
 * NO `/map` CARVE-OUT IS NEEDED, and #506 predicted otherwise. That ticket says
 * splitting these four "turns 4 leaflet tiles on /map into failures". It does
 * not: the transform check below runs AFTER this one, leaflet positions its
 * tiles with `translate3d`, and the home page's spinning logo is the transform
 * artefact named above — so both fall through to that branch and are excused
 * there. `/map` and `/` pass at all four widths. An allowlist would have been
 * dead weight that grew with every future viewport-owning component.
 *
 * WHAT IT DID FIND: six routes with real, pre-existing, previously invisible
 * overflow — `#main-content` scrolls to 368px on `/blog/seo` and 471px on
 * `/accessibility` inside a 320px frame. Those are quarantined in
 * `KNOWN_OVERFLOW` below and ticketed as #511.
 *
 * TWO NOTES ON HOW THAT WAS NEARLY GOT WRONG, both this file's own lesson
 * turned on its author — measure the condition that fails, not the one in front
 * of you:
 *
 *   1. The split was first checked against four routes (`/`, `/map`, `/blog`,
 *      `/themes`), all of which pass, and that was briefly taken to mean it
 *      changed nothing anywhere. It changed six. Four convenient routes are not
 *      forty-two, and three of the six only reproduce AUTHENTICATED, which an
 *      anonymous probe reports as clean.
 *   2. The quarantine was first written with eight entries, because the local
 *      build had no payment keys and rendered a "Payment providers not
 *      configured" panel that CI — which sets dummy keys — never shows. The
 *      build env has to match `e2e.yml`'s or the ledger records defects that
 *      do not exist there.

/*
 * THE KNOWN-OVERFLOW QUARANTINE IS GONE, and how it emptied is worth keeping.
 *
 * When #506 stopped excusing clipped content, this sweep exposed six routes
 * with real, pre-existing, previously invisible overflow. They were quarantined
 * under `test.fail()` — asserting the defect was STILL THERE — rather than
 * skipped, so that fixing one turned the suite red and forced its own removal.
 *
 * It emptied in four steps, and the mechanism earned itself at three of them:
 *
 *   8 -> 6  `/payment-demo` and `/payment-result` never belonged. They were
 *           measured on a local build with no payment keys, which renders a
 *           374px "Payment providers not configured" panel that CI never shows.
 *           Both reported "Expected to fail, but passed". A skip list would
 *           have quarantined two working routes in silence.
 *   6 -> 4  `/account/audit` and `/payment` — header row needed `flex-wrap`.
 *   4 -> 1  `/accessibility` (`.stats` is `inline-grid`, so content-sized, and
 *           its own `overflow-x: auto` had nothing to scroll against), plus a
 *           `<pre>`; `/blog/seo` (grid items default to `min-width: auto`, so
 *           cards held 352px in a 288px column — measured, `min-width: 0` took
 *           493 elements past the viewport down to 4); and a blog author row.
 *   1 -> 0  `/account` — DaisyUI's `.label { white-space: nowrap }`, fixed
 *           globally in `globals.css`. It had shared the header-row defect too,
 *           and `test.fail()` is what distinguished "fixed" from "fixed one of
 *           its two causes".
 *
 * With the list empty the machinery is deleted rather than left at zero: every
 * one of the 42 routes is now simply required to pass. If a route ever needs
 * quarantining again, reintroduce `test.fail()` — never `skip` — and give it a
 * ceiling that only moves down. Full evidence: #511.
