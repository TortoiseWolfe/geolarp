 * Visual regression guard for first-person Walk (`/chatt?diorama&walk`).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: every scene regression in the walk-realism arc — the unlit
 * "dark void", the buildings vanishing into the ground, the over-sepia grade —
 * sailed through console/error checks because nothing threw. Only the *pixels*
 * were wrong. This spec reads the composited frame (a real screenshot, so it
 * captures WebGL via the compositor regardless of preserveDrawingBuffer) and
 * fails if the street level is too dark or too uniform to be the city.
 *
 * WebGL honesty (see tests/e2e/twin-glass-contrast.spec.ts + #288): headless
 * Chromium needs software GL (playwright.visual.config.ts forces SwiftShader). If
 * WebGL is still unavailable we SKIP rather than false-green on a blank canvas.
 *
 * Run: docker exec sh-cod-geolarp-1 pnpm exec playwright test \
 *        --config playwright.visual.config.ts

// on one CI run and failed the next with `Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded`, which reads like
// a product regression and is not one.
//
// The real cost is genuine, not padding: the scene downloads the baked city, builds its
// meshes and bakes the collision BVH before walk can engage — ~15s in the dev container, and
// slower on a CI runner that is simultaneously hosting a full local Supabase stack. The pixel
// test below is budgeted too (a 25s wait plus an 8s settle plus a screenshot already exceeds
