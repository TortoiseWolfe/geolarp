/**
 * Every buy button on /pricing must lead somewhere you can actually buy.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Reported from production 2026-08-07: three of the eight
 * checkout links on /pricing dead-ended on "That package is not available" —
 * `svc-care`, `svc-care-pro` and `prd-foundry`. That was every subscription
 * product on the page. Two were found by the owner clicking them; the third had
 * simply never been clicked.
 *
 * The cause was a split brain. `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` is a hand-maintained
 * literal array (deliberately — the page is a static export and must not fail to
 * build when Supabase is paused), while `/checkout` resolves the SKU against the
 * `products` table and refuses any row with `active = false`. Nothing connected
 * the two, so a product could be deactivated in the database and go on being
 * advertised with a working-looking button indefinitely.
 *
 * This is deliberately a BLACK-BOX check. It needs no database credentials and
 * knows nothing about `active` flags, plan ids, or the literal array — it clicks
 * what a customer would click and asserts they do not hit a wall. That means it
 * also catches causes nobody has thought of yet: a deleted row, a renamed SKU, a
 * typo'd href, a catalog fetch that silently returns nothing.

 * being looked at, not that they got better. Raise this when adding packages;
 * never lower it to make a run pass.

   *
   * So a blanket `toBeVisible()` over every badge can never pass. `prd-foundry`
   * is a developers-lane package, and the developers lane is hidden until its
   * radio is checked. That is what this test used to do, and it failed on `main`
   * for two consecutive runs — not as a flake, as an assertion that contradicted
   * the page's design.
   *
   * Visibility is therefore checked PER LANE, with the lane selected first, and
   * the totals reconciled: every badge must be shown in exactly one lane. That
   * reconciliation is what keeps this from becoming the vacuous version — if the
   * grid stops rendering, or a badge ends up in neither lane, `shown` no longer
   * equals `total` and this fails.
   *
   * The no-clickable-affordance check runs over every badge in both lanes,
   * because that property does not depend on which lane is showing and is the
   * actual subject of the test.
