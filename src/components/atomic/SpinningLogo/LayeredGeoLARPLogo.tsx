 * Comic-ink keyline. The brand fills are fixed and do not follow the theme, so

 * the mark dissolves. A dark keyline gives it definition that does not depend
 * on fill-versus-ground at all: 12.44:1 on white, and inert on dark themes
 * where the fills already carry ~9:1 and need no help.
 *
 * The INTERNAL lines are the part that works on all 35 themes, because they
 * separate shape from shape rather than shape from ground.
 *
 * This is a legibility decision, not a compliance one — WCAG exempts logotypes
 * and nothing in this repo gates the mark. See docs/design/brand-marks/PROVENANCE.md.

/**
 * The geoLARP brand mark, animated.
 *
 * Ported from the Claude Design "geoLARP Logo v3" export, panel 8e
 * ("Motion — gear turns, mallet strikes the brackets"). Geometry comes from
 * docs/design/brand-marks/geolarp-lockup.svg; timings live with the
 * keyframes in globals.css.
 *
 * ## Why this is inline SVG rather than three <Image> layers
 *
 * It used to stack printing-mallet.svg, geolarp-logo.svg and
 * script-tags.svg as three absolutely-positioned next/image elements, spinning
 * only the middle one. That cannot express 8e: the mallet has to swing about
 * its own handle pivot, the brackets flash on the strike, and sparks appear at
 * the point of contact. Animating sub-parts requires them to be in one
 * document, so the mark is inlined.
 *
 * A side effect worth knowing: the three public/*.svg files are no longer on
 * the render path for this component. They remain the canonical standalone
 * assets (and favicon.svg is still the icon-matrix source), but editing them
 * will not change what this renders. The geometry below and those files both
 * derive from the same export.
 *
 * ## The wordmark is opt-in, by size
 *
 * 8e cuts "SCRIPTHAMMER.COM" out of the gear ring via `mask="url(#cut-word)"`,
 * using live Oswald text. Two separate problems came with that, and only one
 * of them still applies:
 *
 *   - The font dependency is GONE. `./ringWordmark` holds the same glyphs baked
 *     to paths, so `wordmark` is safe to use anywhere without Oswald present.
 *   - Legibility is not. The ring text is 38u in a 400u viewBox, so the 30px
 *     nav instance renders it about 3px tall, where it reads as noise on the
 *     teeth rather than as a word.
 *
 * So it is a prop rather than a default: on for the hero, off for the nav and
 * sign-in. Turn it on wherever the mark is drawn at roughly 256px or more.
