/**
 * Every theme the site offers, in picker order.
 *
 * Before #408 this list existed three times — the `themes:` block in
 * `globals.css` and a file-local `const` in both `ThemeSwitcher` and
 * `GlobalNav`. All three agreed, but nothing made them agree: adding a theme
 * meant editing three places, and the only symptom of missing one would have
 * been a theme that renders but never appears in a picker.
 *
 * The landing page held a fourth copy of the fact — a hard-coded `32` — and
 * that is the one that drifted, which is why this file exists.
 *
 * `globals.css` is the one copy TypeScript cannot import, so `themes.test.ts`
 * asserts this list still matches it.
