/**
 * Per-theme WCAG verdicts (#422). The DATA lives in `theme-contrast.json`; this file
 * only gives it a type. Do not edit either by hand — regenerate with:
 *
 *     docker compose exec geolarp node scripts/theme-contrast/generate.mjs
 *
 * WHY THE JSON IS TRACKED. `/themes` renders a badge per theme from it, and a build
 * product cannot be imported (CLAUDE.md: generated artifacts are outputs, never inputs).
 * `scripts/__tests__/theme-contrast-is-current.test.js` recomputes and fails if it
 * drifts — the same arrangement that makes `public/manifest.json` safe to track.
 *
 * WHAT `level` CLAIMS: the worst contrast among `base-content` on
 * `base-100`/`base-200`/`base-300` — body text on the surfaces text actually sits on —
 * judged at WCAG 4.5 (AA) and 7 (AAA).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT: a whole-page audit. A theme can pass here and still place text on a
 * surface no token describes. `color-contrast.spec.ts` is still the only whole-page
 * sweep, and only for the house themes.
 *
 * `uiRatio` is the worst semantic pair (`primary-content on primary` and friends),
 * which are UI/large text judged at 3:1 — the threshold
 * `embed-theme-contrast.spec.ts` already applies to those same pairs. Reported, and
 * deliberately NOT folded into `level`: judging a button label at 4.5 would report most
 * of DaisyUI as failing a standard it does not fail.
