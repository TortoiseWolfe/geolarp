 * wireframes where the manifest listed 66, and 32 themes where 34 were
 * registered. Nothing failed, because nothing was checking.
 *
 * Three of the four are now derived from the thing they describe, so they
 * cannot drift. This file guards the two joints that a type system cannot:
 * the CSS list TypeScript is unable to import, and the one claim with no
 * cheap source of truth.
