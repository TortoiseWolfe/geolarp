/**
 * The 2a "Machine Shop" type stack (#377).
 *
 * Declaring the face here is only step one of three. A `next/font` variable
 * that no CSS rule references paints nothing — which is exactly what Geist did
 * on every page of this site before #377: downloaded, self-hosted, and
 * rendered nowhere, because `@theme` never mapped it to `--font-sans` and the
 * accessibility provider overwrote `body`'s font with an inline style anyway.
 *
 * The other two steps are the `--font-sans` / `--font-mono` / `--font-display`
 * mapping in globals.css `@theme`, and `FONT_FAMILIES` in
 * `@/config/accessibility-tokens`. Change one without the others and the font
 * silently does not apply.
