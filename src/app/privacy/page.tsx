          <p>
            Welcome to geoLARP. We are committed to protecting your privacy
            and ensuring you have a positive experience on our website. This
            privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
            personal information in compliance with the General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable privacy laws.

          <h2>2. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Security audit logs.</strong> We keep a record of
            security-relevant account events — sign-in, sign-out, password
            changes, email verification and similar — together with the IP
            address and browser user-agent they came from. These records are
            retained for <strong>90 days</strong> and are then deleted
            automatically. You can see your own entries; they are not visible to
            other users.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Account data.</strong> Information tied to your account is
            kept for as long as the account exists. When you delete your
            account, records that reference it — including the security audit
            log entries above — are removed with it.
