 * Apply a theme and persist it, honouring cookie consent.
 *
 * Extracted from `ThemeSwitcher` (#382) because `/themes` now offers a second
 * way to switch — the curated plates — and this is more than a
 * `setAttribute` call: it writes html AND body, chooses storage based on
 * consent, broadcasts to other tabs, and tells the service worker. A second
 * copy would have drifted from the first the moment either changed, which is
 * the failure #408 removed from the theme LIST and would have reintroduced in
 * the theme ACTION.
 *
 * Callers own their own React state; this touches the DOM and storage only.
