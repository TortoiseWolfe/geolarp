# GeoLARP

A location-based Live Action Role Playing game with D7 dice mechanics.

## Project Status

ðŸ§¹ **Clean Slate** - Ready for fresh implementation

The Next.js prototype has been removed to make way for a proper implementation that aligns with the Product Requirement Plans.

## D7 System Features

### Dice Pool Mechanics
- Attributes use dice pools (1D7 to 7D7) instead of static values
- West End Games style pips system (+1, +2, converts to dice at +3)
- Maximum of 7D7 for heroic-level characters
- Skills add dice to attribute pools
- Exponential advancement with level progression

### Core Attributes
- **Strength** - Physical prowess
- **Agility** - Speed and dexterity  
- **Intellect** - Mental acuity
- **Spirit** - Willpower and awareness
- **Luck** - Fortune and fate

### Location-Based Classes
- **Rogue** - Urban environments
- **Ranger** - Parks and forests
- **Merchant** - Commercial districts
- **Guardian** - Residential areas
- **Artificer** - Industrial zones
- **Mariner** - Waterfront areas

## Development Philosophy: PRP-Driven

This project uses **Product Requirement Plans (PRPs)** - specifications that guide implementation through a clear lifecycle.

### PRP Workflow
```
1. Create PRP in /docs/prp/queue/
2. Activate (move to /docs/prp/active/)
3. Implement in code
4. Validate with tests
5. Archive and extract decisions
```

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Technology Stack**
   - Select framework that aligns with D7 dice pool system
   - Consider mobile-first, offline-capable architecture
   - Ensure privacy-first approach

2. **Implement Core Mechanics**
   - D7 dice pool system (not static values!)
   - Pips system (+1, +2, converts at +3)
   - Proper attribute scaling (1D7 to 7D7)

3. **Build Character System**
   - Dice pool attributes
   - Location-based class detection
   - Skill system with dice additions

4. **Develop Location Features**
   - Privacy-respecting geolocation
   - Zone-based gameplay
   - Offline capability

## Contributing

1. Review the PRPs in `/docs/prp/queue/`
2. Understand the D7 dice pool system
3. Ensure any implementation uses dice pools, not static values
4. Follow the PRP workflow for new features
