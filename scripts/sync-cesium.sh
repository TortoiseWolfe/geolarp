# Sync CesiumJS's static runtime assets from node_modules into public/cesium/
# so the Next.js static export serves them alongside the app.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Cesium loads four asset trees at RUNTIME by URL, not through the bundler:
#   Workers/     web workers (terrain/geometry decode) — nothing renders without them
#   Assets/      IAU2006_XYS earth-orientation, approximateTerrainHeights.json
#                (required by clampToGround), skybox + textures
#   ThirdParty/  draco/basis decoders for glTF + 3D Tiles
#   Widgets/     widget CSS + images
# It finds them via `window.CESIUM_BASE_URL`, which the app sets to
# getAssetUrl('/cesium/') — see src/twin/cesium/. Only getAssetUrl() is correct
# across all four basePath regimes ('' on the CNAME'd production deploy, ''
# under DISABLE_BASE_PATH, '/geoLARP' for the basepath E2E job and local
# .env). Never hardcode the prefix.
#
# The npm package ships these prebuilt under Build/Cesium/, so no postinstall is
# needed — cesium's own `prepare` script is repo tooling (gulp/husky/playwright)
# and pnpm is right to block it. We deliberately do NOT copy Build/Cesium/
# Cesium.js or index.js (~10MB): webpack bundles the library itself from the
# package's `module` entry. Only the runtime-fetched trees belong in public/.
#
# public/cesium/ is GITIGNORED and generated: ~8MB of vendored binaries that can
# drift from the lockfile is exactly the debt the constitution forbids —
# node_modules/cesium is the single source of truth. Same call as
# public/wireframes/.
#
# Wired into BOTH `dev` and `prebuild` in package.json, because `pnpm dev` does
# not run `prebuild` — that is precisely why sync-wireframes.sh is listed twice.
