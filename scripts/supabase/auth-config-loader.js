/**
 * Load `auth-config.json`, resolving `${VAR:-default}` against the environment (#734).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `auth-config.json` is the checked-in DESIRED STATE that
 * `auth-config-drift.yml` compares the live Supabase project against, daily and on
 * every push to main. It held eight values specific to this instance — site URL,
 * allow-list, SMTP host/user/sender, and both OAuth client ids — and nothing
 * rewrote them on fork. So a fork inherited geoLARP's identity as its
 * *declared correct configuration*, and the gate then reported drift against values
 * that were never theirs. Their options were to edit the file or stop believing the
 * gate; both are bad, and the second is worse.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST READ THE VALUES FROM ENV. Because that breaks what the gate is for.
 * It compares LIVE prod against a value **pinned in the repo**. If the expected value
 * came from the runner's environment, both sides could drift together and the check
 * could never fire — and #287 is precisely "prod drifted while every test stayed
 * green". `${VAR:-default}` keeps a pinned default so geoLARP's own gate still
 * detects real drift, while letting a fork declare its own expectation in CI without
 * editing the file.
 *
 * WHAT A FORK THAT CONFIGURES NOTHING GETS: the geoLARP defaults, and a gate
 * that fails LOUDLY against their project. That is the correct outcome — it tells
 * them to configure rather than passing silently. Silence is the failure mode this
 * whole file exists to remove.
 *
 * CommonJS on purpose: `scripts/__tests__/canonical-artifacts.test.js` is
 * `node:test` + `require`, `tests/unit/auth-config-validity.test.ts` is Vitest, and
 * `set-auth-config.ts` runs under tsx. One CJS module serves all three, and a single
 * shared loader is the only way the pinned file and the three readers cannot
 * disagree about what the desired state actually is.
