/**
 * Assert that LIVE production still delivers a Content-Security-Policy that a browser
 * will actually honour (#393).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The policy was authored in `src/app/layout.tsx` under
 * `metadata.other`, which renders `<meta name="Content-Security-Policy">`. A CSP in
 * `<meta name>` form is INERT — browsers honour only `<meta http-equiv>` or the HTTP
 * header. So a carefully maintained ten-directive policy was enforced exactly never.
 * Verified behaviourally before the fix: loading a stylesheet from an origin the policy
 * excludes fired `onload` and produced zero `securitypolicyviolation` events.
 *
 * That is the same family as the cache rules #635 fixed, and it has the same shape as
 * a problem: the cure lives in a Cloudflare Response Header Transform Rule, in a
 * dashboard, NOT in this repository. Delete the rule, rotate the token or move the zone
 * and the policy vanishes silently, leaving behind exactly what was there before — a
 * site with no CSP and no way to notice.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS
 *
 *   1. A CSP header is present at all (enforcing OR report-only).
 *   2. It is served through Cloudflare (`cf-ray`), since the edge is what sets it.
 *   3. The directives that carry the security value are present, not merely SOME
 *      header — a policy trimmed to `default-src 'self'` would pass a presence check
 *      while allowing everything the real one names.
 *   4. `object-src 'none'` and `base-uri 'self'` survive: both are cheap, neither has
 *      a legitimate use here, and both are common first casualties of loosening.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
 *
 *   - Whether the policy is ENFORCING rather than report-only. It ships report-only
 *     first, by design, because enforcing an untested policy breaks sign-up and
 *     checkout silently — `js.stripe.com` loads a script AND an iframe on /checkout/
 *     and appeared in neither directive before this work. Tighten this script to
 *     require the enforcing header as part of the flip, and not before.
 *   - Whether every origin the site needs is allowed. That is what report-only mode
 *     is collecting; a header can be perfectly delivered and still wrong.

// THE FALLBACK USED TO BE THE UPSTREAM DOMAIN (#133), so running this by hand
// without an argument silently probed a DIFFERENT SITE and reported confident
// results about it. CI always passes the URL explicitly, so this only ever bit
// someone running it manually — in the way hardest to notice. Same chain as
// `scripts/ci/check-cache-headers.mjs:49-55`, which fixed the same defect first.
//
// THIS ONE FAILED IN THE WORSE DIRECTION. A bare run exited 0 with
// "OK — delivered and honoured, in report-only mode" about the upstream domain,
// while geolarp.com is ENFORCING with 14 directives against that site's 11. A gate
// reporting success about a thing it is not looking at is the most expensive
// possible answer (`scripts/__tests__/no-inherited-supabase-ref.test.js`).
