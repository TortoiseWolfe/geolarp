/**
 * Assert that the LIVE mail policy for the domain is still what this repo intends (#822).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The DMARC record, the SPF record, the DKIM key and the inbound MX all live
 * in Cloudflare's dashboard, not in this tree. Nothing here would notice if one were deleted,
 * a token rotated, or the zone moved — which is exactly the gap #635 documented for the cache
 * rules, where the next detector was a human opening a browser.
 *
 * For mail the failure is worse, because it is SILENT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS:
 *
 *   - Lose the MX and `admin@` stops receiving. The security policy (#881) starts dropping
 *     vulnerability reports again, and nobody here sees a thing — the reporter gets a bounce.
 *   - Lose the DKIM key and transactional mail stops aligning. Under `p=none` nothing visibly
 *     breaks, so the damage is invisible until enforcement is raised, at which point real
 *     payment receipts start being quarantined.
 *   - Lose the DMARC record and the domain is spoofable again, silently.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. This does not verify that mail is DELIVERED, and it cannot: that needs a
 * receiver's aggregate reports, which arrive by email days later. It asserts the published
 * policy matches the declared intent below. That is the difference between "the config we
 * meant is still there" and "mail works" — and only the first is checkable from CI.
 *
 * RAISING ENFORCEMENT. `p=` is declared here on purpose. Tightening the policy is then a
 * one-line, reviewable change in this repo that CI enforces against live DNS, instead of an
 * undocumented dashboard edit nothing records. See #822 for why it is still `none`.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/ci/check-mail-policy.mjs [domain]     # default geolarp.com
 *   node scripts/ci/check-mail-policy.mjs --selftest

/**
 * The mail policy this repository intends to be published.
 *
 * `p: 'none'` is deliberate and currently correct — #822 has the reasoning. Two things must
 * be true before it is raised, and neither is today:
 *
 *   1. Enough `rua` aggregate reports to show every legitimate sender aligns. In the 30 days
 *      to 2026-08-21 exactly ONE report arrived (Google, covering one day).
 *   2. #368 closed. Replies to `admin@` still leave through a personal Gmail, which is not in
 *      the root SPF and does not DKIM-sign as the domain — so `p=quarantine` would quarantine
 *      the maintainer's own replies.
