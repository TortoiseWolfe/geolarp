#   - TEST_USER_*_EMAIL/PASSWORD vars

# FORWARD THE TARGET INTO THE CONTAINER (#877).
#
# This is the mechanism that caused the incident, and it is not obvious: each
# `docker compose exec` below starts a fresh process whose environment comes from the
# CONTAINER, not from this shell. So `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... ./setup-e2e-users.sh`
# has no effect whatsoever — the seeders read the container's `.env`, which points at the
# cloud project. Passing `-e` explicitly is the only thing that works here.
