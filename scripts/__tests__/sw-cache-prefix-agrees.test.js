/**
 * What the build STAMPS into the service worker and what the worker PURGES must be
 * the same prefix (#939).
 *
 * ## The bug this exists to prevent
 *
 * `public/sw.js` names its caches `<brand>-v<semver>…` and its `activate` handler
 * deletes old ones by matching that brand prefix. `scripts/stamp-sw-version.mjs`
 * rewrites the version at build time. For a while the prefix was written down in
 * BOTH files, and they diverged: `rebrand.sh` sweeps `.js` but not `.mjs`, so a fork
 * rebranded the worker to its own name and left the stamp script writing the
 * template's. The build then produced a worker that created `scripthammer-…` caches
 * and purged `geolarp-…` ones. Nothing ever matched, so every deploy added caches
 * that could never be collected — unbounded storage growth in visitors' browsers.
 *
 * It shipped to production and no test noticed, because the guard in the stamp script
 * compared the version it had just built against the very constant it built it from.
 * A tautology cannot fail.
 *
 * ## Why these assertions and not a simpler one
 *
 * Asserting "both files contain the string `geolarp-`" would re-create the original
 * defect in test form: two copies that agree today and can drift tomorrow, and which
 * a rebrand would rewrite in one place only. So instead:
 *
 *   1. the worker must not hard-code a brand in its purge — it must derive it
 *   2. the stamp script must not hard-code one either — it must read the worker
 *   3. and, behaviourally, stamping a worker with an ARBITRARY brand must produce a
 *      version carrying that same brand. (3) is the one that would have caught the
 *      original bug, because it does not care what the brand is.
