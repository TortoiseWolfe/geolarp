/**
 * `text-base-content` must not be dimmed by opacity at all (#411, #462).
 *
 * WHY A GUARD AND NOT JUST A FIX. #411 measured these failing the 7:1 AAA gate and
 * removed them. They came back — eight live instances in `src/twin/cesium/` and two in
 * a story, found on 2026-08-18 while working #462. Nothing noticed for months, and
 * nothing could have: #459 records that axe-core returns a **pass** with
 * `contrastRatio: null` for these nodes, so `color-contrast.spec.ts` — which asserts on
 * `violations` — has been green on them the whole time. A removal without a guard is a
 * removal that gets undone.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT, from #462 (canvas readback, because `getComputedStyle` returns
 * `oklch()` unparsed). Gate is 7:1, `geolarp-light`:
 *
 *              /100    /85    /80    /70
 *   base-100  12.96   8.30   7.08   5.20   <- /70 fails
 *   base-200  11.73   7.73   6.62   4.98   <- /80 and below fail
 *   base-300  10.10   6.88   6.05   4.57   <- /85 and below fail
 *
 * So `/70` and below fail on EVERY surface in the light theme, with no judgement call
 * about which surface the text landed on. That is what this file pins.
 *
 * `/80` AND `/85` ARE NOW BANNED TOO, and the reason the old note here gave for sparing
 * them turned out to be wrong. It said they were "surface-DEPENDENT" — `/80` passing on
 * `base-100` at 7.08 — but that table measures only `geolarp-light`. Recomputed
 * across ALL 35 enabled themes (composite in sRGB, then WCAG 2.x luminance, via
 * scripts/theme-contrast/compute.mjs):
 *
 *              cells failing 7:1     worst ratio    a surface safe on every theme?
 *   /85          29 of 105              4.01                    NONE
 *   /80          38 of 105              3.78                    NONE
 *
 * There is no surface on which either is safe, so there was never a per-call-site
 * judgement to make — the worst cases sit at roughly half the gate. The 184-instance
 * sweep the old note deferred is done.
 *
 * This is why the regex now bans every opacity below 100 rather than a hand-picked set:
 * "which opacities are safe" depends on the theme set, and the theme set changes.
 *
 * The instances found in 2026-08 were worse than the table suggests: they sat on
 * `bg-base-100/90` with `backdrop-blur`, floating over the Cesium canvas, at 10-11px.
 * The table assumes OPAQUE surfaces, so a translucent panel over an arbitrary 3D
 * backdrop is unbounded-worse than its worst row — the #715 lesson.
