/**
 * `auth-config.json` is the desired state a daily gate compares live prod against,
 * and it now carries `${VAR:-default}` so a fork can declare its own expectation
 * without editing a file it is meant to reuse (#734).
 *
 * Two things have to hold at once, and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *   1. geoLARP's own gate must still detect real drift — so the DEFAULT has to
 *      survive interpolation exactly, byte for byte. If interpolation quietly
 *      changed a pinned value, the gate would start reporting drift that is not
 *      there, and the first response to a noisy gate is to stop believing it.
 *   2. A fork's override must actually take effect — otherwise this whole change is
 *      decoration and the fork is back to editing the file by hand.
 *
 * The two structural tests at the bottom are the ones that will still be earning
 * their keep in a year. They pin FORK_OVERRIDABLE to the two things that have to
 * agree with it — the config file that declares the placeholders, and the workflow
 * that feeds them to the runner. A key added to one and not the others is exactly
 * the omission that let CRUDkit's monogram reach a live client site (#659), and the
 * workflow half is where it hides best: everything reads as configurable, and the
 * runner simply never receives the values.
