/**
 * The mail-policy guard must be able to say NO (#822).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. DMARC, SPF, the DKIM key and the inbound MX all live in Cloudflare's
 * dashboard, not in this tree. #822 says so explicitly under "Not automatable from this
 * repo", and draws the parallel to #635, where the cache rules lived outside the repo and
 * the next detector was a human opening a browser and seeing a white page.
 *
 * For mail the failure is silent in both directions, which is worse:
 *
 *   - lose the MX and `admin@` stops receiving, so the security policy (#881) quietly goes
 *     back to dropping vulnerability reports;
 *   - lose the DKIM key and transactional mail stops aligning — invisible while `p=none`,
 *     and it only surfaces as quarantined payment receipts once enforcement is raised;
 *   - lose the DMARC record and the domain is spoofable again, with no signal at all.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS. That the checker reaches BOTH verdicts, over the real module rather than a
 * reimplementation of its rules — a checker only ever observed passing has not been shown to
 * work, which is the whole subject of #396.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT hit the network. Live DNS belongs in `smoke.yml`, where a
 * post-deploy check is expected to talk to the outside world; a unit test that depends on
 * resolution would fail for reasons unrelated to the code and get skipped.
