/**
 * Every asset a web-app manifest promises must exist, at the size it claims.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (#659). Nothing checked, and three separate bugs were living
 * in the two manifest emitters at once:
 *
 *   1. `src/config/project.config.ts` pointed at `/screenshot-wide.png` and
 *      `/screenshot-narrow.png`. Neither file has ever existed. Verified 404 on
 *      production while writing this.
 *   2. `scripts/generate-manifest.js` declared `screenshots/mobile.png` as
 *      `390x844` — a CSS viewport, not the file, which is 750x1334. Chrome
 *      drops a screenshot whose declared size disagrees with the image, so the
 *      install sheet silently lost it.
 *   3. The two emitters named DIFFERENT icon sets, so which mark a fork
 *      installed with depended on which emitter won.
 *
 * All three are invisible from the app: a manifest with a broken `src` does not
 * throw, it just quietly degrades the install experience. The only way to see
 * it is to check the files.
 *
 * THE TWO EMITTERS ARE READ AS TEXT, deliberately. `project.config.ts` is
 * TypeScript and `generate-manifest.js` is CommonJS that runs at prebuild; both
 * build their `src` values by template-interpolating a basePath, so there is no
 * single importable value to assert on. Scanning the source for the literal
 * paths is what catches a hand-edit in either file, which is exactly how all
 * three bugs above got in.
