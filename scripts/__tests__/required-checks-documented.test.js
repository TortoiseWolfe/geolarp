/**
 * CLAUDE.md's account of which checks block a merge must stay true (#782).
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. `E2E (local) result` became a required context on 2026-08-15
 * when #739 closed. CLAUDE.md went on saying "Required checks are `Test (20.x)`
 * and `accessibility` only" and, a few hundred lines earlier, that the local lane
 * was "ADVISORY, not required" — contradicting both reality and itself.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic drift. A `gh pr merge` refused with "the base branch
 * policy prohibits the merge" while both DOCUMENTED checks were green, which reads
 * as a broken protection rule or a `gh` bug rather than a third check still
 * running. It also makes docs-only PRs look cheaper than they are — they now wait
 * on a full E2E lane, which matters directly to the merge-pacing rules around #548.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT CHECK, said plainly so a green run is not over-read: whether
 * the list matches LIVE branch protection. `GET /branches/{b}/protection` needs
 * admin scope, which CI's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not have. Asserting it here
 * would mean a network call and a privileged token inside the unit suite.
 *
 * So this asserts what IS decidable offline and is where the bug actually lived:
 * that CLAUDE.md agrees with itself, and that every check it calls required comes
 * from a workflow which can legitimately BE required. Verify against live
 * protection with:
 *
 *   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/main/protection --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
