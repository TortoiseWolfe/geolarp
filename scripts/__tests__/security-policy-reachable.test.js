/**
 * The security policy must be FINDABLE, and the address in it must RECEIVE MAIL (#881).
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. Both halves failed at once, and each was invisible from inside the repo:
 *
 *   1. `SECURITY.md` lived at `docs/project/SECURITY.md`. GitHub only detects a security
 *      policy in the repository root, `.github/`, or `docs/` — it does not recurse. So
 *      `/repos/.../community/profile` returned no `security_policy` key at all, the repo had
 *      no Security tab entry and no "Report a vulnerability" affordance. Someone looking for
 *      how to report found nothing.
 *   2. The policy told people to email `security@geolarp.com`. Cloudflare Email Routing
 *      for the zone had exactly one rule — `admin@` → the maintainer — with the catch-all
 *      DISABLED, so mail to `security@` was rejected at the edge.
 *
 * Together: the policy asked reporters not to open a public issue, then dropped the private
 * report. The more responsible the reporter, the more completely it was lost — and nothing on
 * this side would ever show a report had been attempted.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT CHECK. It cannot query Cloudflare — CI has no zone token, and a
 * test that silently skips when a credential is absent is its own #396 instance. What it CAN
 * do is force the question: any `@geolarp.com` address published to outsiders must appear
 * in ROUTED_ADDRESSES below, and adding one to that list means someone confirmed the route.
 * The command to confirm it is recorded here so the check is cheap to redo.
