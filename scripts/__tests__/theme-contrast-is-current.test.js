/**
 * The committed per-theme verdicts must still match the themes (#422).
 *
 * `src/config/theme-contrast.ts` is tracked on purpose — `/themes` imports it to render
 * a badge per theme, and CLAUDE.md forbids importing a build product ("generated
 * artifacts are OUTPUTS, never inputs"). The same arrangement makes `public/manifest.json`
 * safe to track: a tracked artifact plus a test that regenerates and compares.
 *
 * WITHOUT THIS TEST THE BADGES ROT SILENTLY, which is worse than having no badges. A
 * DaisyUI upgrade, a token edit in `globals.css`, or a newly enabled theme would leave a
 * plate asserting "AAA" from a number nobody recomputed — the #287 failure mode that
 * #422 exists to avoid, reintroduced by the fix for it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, stated so a green run is not over-read: that the conversion
 * from `oklch()` to sRGB is itself correct. That is
 * `tests/e2e/oklch-browser-parity.spec.ts`, which compares all 536 theme colours against
 * what Chromium actually paints. This test only proves the committed file agrees with the
 * computation; the parity spec proves the computation agrees with reality.
