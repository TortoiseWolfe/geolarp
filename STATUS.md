## What Closes the v0.0.x → v0.1.0 Gap

If we want a stable v0.1.0, three families of work close it:

### A. Stability — fix the post-remake regression patterns (highest leverage)

The `feat/repo-overhaul-merge` of 2026-03-04 introduced patterns that have caused **18+ reverts in 3 months** and a 5x increase in fix-rate. The same shapes repeat in code that wasn't reverted yet:

| Hotspot                           | Status   | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ProtectedRoute auth race**      | Resolved | 3 prior reverts: 6b4c13a, 2c97e67, 259b38d. AdminGate now extracted to its own file with a 10-test regression suite pinning the `wasAdmin` debounce, the `cancelled` flag, and dep-array integrity. Closed by [#51](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer/issues/51) (PR #56).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **ConversationView regression**   | Resolved | `createClient()` calls in `useConversationRealtime.ts:46` and `useTypingIndicator.ts:32` are now wrapped in `useMemo(() => createClient(), [])`. Comment in code names the prior revert (adae629).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **GDPR consent Firefox**          | Resolved | `PaymentConsentModal.tsx:46-59` defers `acceptButtonRef.focus()` via `requestAnimationFrame()` after `dialog.showModal()`. Comment names the prior revert (3e67772).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Offline-queue IndexedDB drift** | Resolved | Watchdog reclaim (60s default) + `payment_intents.idempotency_key` partial unique index + upsert-with-ignoreDuplicates. At-least-once delivery + idempotent receiver = exactly-once observable outcome. Closed by [#52](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer/issues/52) (PR #59).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **E2E flake mitigation**          | Resolved | 10 rounds. Rounds 1-9 attacked symptoms (stale closures, unstable hook refs, hydration timing, retry budgets, stagger delays, Supabase priming). Round 10 (#89, commit 996211e) found the underlying cause: two concurrent E2E CI runs racing against one Supabase project — fixed via repo-wide `concurrency:` mutex in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` plus an explicit `dispatchEvent('scroll')` after each programmatic `el.scrollTop = N` to work around WebKit's quirk of not auto-firing scroll events. |

The full code-review findings (35 high-confidence items) live in [`scripts/audit/code-review-findings.json`](scripts/audit/code-review-findings.json). The pattern is consistent: stale closures after async auth, unstabilized context providers, hooks creating new Supabase clients every render.

### B. Payment activation — small effort, big unlock

024/038/039/040/041 are ~75% built. 042 RLS shipped (#44). To take the rest green:

1. Create Stripe sandbox + PayPal developer accounts (~30-60 min external setup)
2. Populate 6 keys in `.env` + Supabase Vault
3. Wire 3 missing routes (`/payment-dashboard`, `/payment-subscriptions`, `/payment-history`); `/payment-result` already shipped — see 040 entry for its remaining UX gaps
4. Build offline-queue UI affordances (status indicator, sync pill, retry button)
5. As each route lands, remove the corresponding skips from `tests/e2e/payment/` per [#53](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer/issues/53)

GitHub issues #3, #4, #5, #43 track the route work; #53 is the test-skip index.

### C. Test coverage — known gaps

- **033**: `src/lib/seo/technical.ts` (429 LOC, 0 tests)
- **035**: `message-service.ts` (1200+ LOC), `key-service.ts`, `group-key-service.ts`, `audit-logger.ts` — all untested
- **037**: visual a11y for game components

## Snapshot — This Audit's Methodology

- 4 parallel `Explore` agents audited each of 47 feature spec dirs against `src/` code, `tests/` files, and the wireframes manifest
- 3 parallel `code-reviewer` agents swept `src/components/`, `src/lib/+services/`, and `src/contexts/+hooks/+app/` with confidence threshold ≥0.80
- Cross-referenced against existing trustworthy doc `docs/prp-docs/PRP-STATUS.md` (last updated 2026-04-08, covered 15 features)
- All 47 spec.md `**Status:**` fields were stale; they're now corrected (see Phase 4 commits)
